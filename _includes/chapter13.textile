In this Section we consider how to reduce _multiple capacitor_ or _multiple inductor_ energy storage elements into a single corresponding equivalent, respectively.  At this time we consider circuits with only capacitors or only inductors. At another time you will encounter circuits with both capacitors and inductors simultaneously _in the same circuit_.

Recall with resistors we developed methods to reduce a connection of multiple resistors to just a single resistor.  This was accomplished by series and parallel reductions.  Here the same 'concept' of series (equal current) and parallel (equal voltage) connections is applied to establish ways to combine multiple energy storage elements into an *equivalent* single element.


h4(#chapter13-mulitple-capacitors). 13.1 - Multiple-Capacitor Equivalents

When multiple capacitors are connected together we need to consider the type of connection.  As we have previously identified with resistors, multiple elements may be connected so they share the same current (series), or connected so they share the same voltage (parallel).

** *_13.1.1 Series Connected Capacitors_*

The case of two capacitors connected in series is depicted in "Figure 13.1":#figure13-1.


p=(#figure13-1). !{width:70%}img/13/circuitsF13.1.jpg(Figure 13.1)!:img/13/circuitsF13.1.jpg
_Figure 13.1  Series Connected Capacitors and Equivalent_

In this series connection the current, $i_C$, is common to both capacitors.  Thus by the capacitor constraints:

p=. $i_C$ =  $C_1$ $\frac{dv_1}{dt}$ = $C_2$ $\frac{dv_2}{dt}$

re-arranging:

p=. $\frac{dv_1}{dt}$ = $\frac{i_C}{C_1}$ ... and ... $\frac{dv_2}{dt}$ = $\frac{i_C}{C_2}$

but, also for the equivalent:

p=. $i_C$ = $C_{eq}$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$

so

p=. $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ = $\frac{i_C}{C_{eq}}$

but by KVL:

p=. $v_C$ = $v_1$ + $v_2$

by substitution:

p=. $\frac{i_C}{C_{eq}}$ = $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ = $\frac{dv_1 + dv_2}{dt}$ = $\frac{dv_1}{dt}$ + $\frac{dv_2}{dt}$ = $\frac{i_C}{C_1}$ + $\frac{i_C}{C_2}$ = $i_C(\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2})$

Hence,

p=. $\frac{1}{C_{eq}}$ = $(\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2})$  .....  Eq'n 13.1

This equation gives the equivalent capacitance for _two capacitors connected in series_.  And by extension the equivalent for *'N' capacitors in series* is:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{1}{C_{eq}}$ = $(\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + - - - + \frac{1}{C_N})$ </h4>

Notice this capacitor _series equivalent_ is the same form obtained for the _equivalent with resistors in parallel_.  To decrease a capacitance, just add more capacitors in series.


** *_13.1.2 Parallel Connected Capacitors_*

The case of two capacitors connected in _parallel_ is depicted in "Figure 13.2":#figure13-2.


p=(#figure13-2). !{width:75%}img/13/circuitsF13.2.jpg(Figure 13.2)!:img/13/circuitsF13.2.jpg
_Figure 13.2  Parallel Connected Capacitors and Equivalent_

In this parallel connection the voltage, $v_C$, is _common to both capacitors_.  Thus by the capacitor constraints:

p=. $i_{C1}$ = $C_1$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ ... and ... $i_{C2}$ = $C_2$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$

also for the equivalent:

p=. $i_C$ = $C_{eq}$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$

but by KCL:

p=. $i_C$ = $i_{C1}$ + $i_{C2}$

by substitution:

p=. $i_C$ = $C_1$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ + $C_2$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ = $C_{eq}$ $\frac{dv_C}{dt}$

Hence:

p=. $C_{eq}$ = $C_1$ + $C_2$

This equation gives the equivalent capacitance for two capacitors in parallel.  And by extension the equivalent for *'N' capacitors in parallel* is:

<h4>
p=. $C_{eq}$ = $C_1$ + $C_2$ + - - -  +$C_N$</h4>

Notice this capacitor parallel equivalent is the _same form_ obtained for the equivalent with resistors in series, they add.  To increase a capacitance, just connect additional capacitors in parallel.


** *_13.1.3 Series - Parallel Capacitor Equivalent Example_*

For groups of connected capacitors we can often reduce them to a single equivalent. To do this we use a similar process used for the reduction of a group of connected resistors elements to a single equivalent resistance by _sequentially_ recognizing elements that are in-series and/or in-parallel, and applying the corresponding reduction at each case.

Consider the example group of capacitors in "Figure 13.3":#figure13-3.


p=(#figure13-3). !{width:50%}img/13/circuitsF13.3.jpg(Figure 13.3)!:img/13/circuitsF13.3.jpg
_Figure 13.3  Example Capacitor Series-Parallel Reduction_

To reduce this group of capacitors, (A) first recognize that the three 2µF capacitors are connected _in-parallel_, so they can be replaced by a single equivalent 6 µF capacitor, "Figure 13.3a":#figure13-3a.


p=(#figure13-3a). !{width:50%}img/13/circuitsF13.3a.jpg(Figure 13.3a)!:img/13/circuitsF13.3a.jpg
_Figure 13.3a  First Reduction for Capacitor Group_

Next (B) two capacitors (the 6µF and 1F) are seen to have the same current and thus are in-series.  But these two have very different capacitance values so the series combination is just:

p=. $C_{eq}$ = $\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$

so with values:

p=. $C_{eq}$ = $\frac{6x10^{-6} x 1}{(6x10^{-6}+1)}$ = $\frac{6x10^{-6}}{1.000006}$

The resultant equivalent is essentially 6µF for practical purposes, often 3 decimal places is sufficient accuracy.  The resultant equivalent circuit reduces to just two capacitors, "Figure 13.3b":#figure13-3b.


p=(#figure13-3b). !{width:45%}img/13/circuitsF13.3b.jpg(Figure 13.3b)!:img/13/circuitsF13.3b.jpg
_Figure 13.3b  Second Reduction of Capacitor Group_

And finally, (C) since these two capacitors have the same voltage and are _in-parallel_, their values add to yield the final single capacitor equivalent of 9 µF, "Figure 13.3c":#figure13-3c.


p=(#figure13-3c). !{width:30%}img/13/circuitsF13.3c.jpg(Figure 13.3c)!:img/13/circuitsF13.3c.jpg
_Figure 13.3c  Final Reduction to Single Capacitor Equivalent_

The original circuit of 5 capacitors is thus reduced to a single capacitor of value 9 $\mu F$.  From the terminals A-A', the single capacitor yields the same $i-v$ characteristic as occurs for the original 5 capacitor circuit at terminals A-A'.


h4(#chapter13-mulitple-inductors). 13.2 - Multiple-Inductor Equivalents

In this Section we consider how to reduce multiple inductor energy storage elements into a single corresponding equivalent.  At this time we consider circuits with only inductors. At another time you will encounter circuits with _both_ capacitors and inductors simultaneously in the same circuit.

Recall with resistors we developed methods to reduce a connection of multiple resistors to just a single resistor.  This was accomplished by series and parallel reductions.  Here the same 'concept' is used to establish ways to combine multiple inductors into an equivalent single inductor.

When multiple inductors are connected together we need to consider the type of connection.  As we have previously identified with resistors and capacitors, multiple elements may be connected so they share the same current (series), or connected so they share the same voltage (_parallel_).  The case of inductors in series connection is depicted in "Figure 13.4":#figure13-4.


p=(#figure13-4). !{width:70%}img/13/circuitsF13.4.jpg(Figure 13.4)!:img/13/circuitsF13.4.jpg
_Figure 13.4  Series Connected Inductors and Equivalent_

In this series connection current, $i_L$, is common to both inductors.  Thus we can write the individual inductor voltages, $v_{L1}$ and $v_{L2}$, according to the inductor constraint relation as:

p=. $v_{L1}$ = $L_1$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$  .....  and  .....  $v_{L2}$ $L_2$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$

and also for the equivalent inductance:

p=. $v_L$ = $L_{eq}$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$

but, by KVL:

p=. $v_L$ = $v_{L1}$ + $v_{L2}$

so by substitution:

p=. $v_L$ = $L_1$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$ + $L_2$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$ = $L_{eq}$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$

p=. $L_{eq}$ = $L_1$ + $L_2$

This equation gives the equivalent inductance for _two inductors in series_.  And by extension the equivalent for *'N' inductors in series* is:

<h4>
p=. $L_{eq}$ = $L_1$ + $L_2$ + --- + $L_N$

Notice this inductor series equivalent is the same form obtained for the series equivalent for resistors.  To increase an inductance value, just add more inductors in series.


** *_13.2.1 Parallel Connected Inductors_*

The case of two inductors connected in parallel is depicted in "Figure 13.5":#figure13-5.


p=(#figure13-5). !{width:70%}img/13/circuitsF13.5.jpg(Figure 13.5)!:img/13/circuitsF13.5.jpg
_Figure 13.5  Parallel Connected Inductors and Equivalent_

In this _parallel connection_ the voltage, $v_L$, is common to both inductors.  Thus by the inductor constraints:

p=. $v_L$ = $L_1$ $\frac{dL_{L1}}{dt}$ = $L_2$ $\frac{di_{L2}}{dt}$

and also for the equivalent:

p=. $v_L$ = $L_{eq}$ $\frac{di_L}{dt}$

but by KCL:

p=. $i_L$ = $i_{L1}$ + $i_{L2}$

and taking the derivative:

p=. $\frac{di_L}{dt}$ = $\frac{d(i_{L1} + i_{L2})}{dt}$ = $\frac{di_{L1}}{dt}$ + $\frac{di_{L2}}{dt}$

or by substitution:

p=. $\frac{v_L}{L_{eq}}$ = $\frac{v_L}{L_1}$ + $\frac{v_L}{L_2}$

Hence:

p=. $\frac{1}{L_{eq}}$ = $\frac{1}{L_1}$ + $\frac{1}{L_2}$

This equation gives the equivalent inductance for two inductors in parallel.  And by extension the equivalent for *'N' inductors in parallel* is:

p=. $\frac{1}{L_{eq}}$ = $\frac{1}{L_1}$ + $\frac{1}{L_2}$ + --- + $\frac{1}{L_N}$

Notice this inductor parallel equivalent is the same form obtained for the equivalent of parallel resistors.  To decrease an inductance value, just connect additional inductors in parallel.

** *_13.2.2	Series - Parallel Inductors Equivalent Example_*

For groups of connected inductors we can often reduce them to a single equivalent. To do this we use a similar process that was used for the reduction of a group of connected resistor elements to a single equivalent resistance, namely by sequentially recognizing subgroups of elements that are either in-series and/or in-parallel, and applying the corresponding reduction for each case.

Consider the example group of inductors in "Figure 13.6":#figure13-6.


p=(#figure13-6). !{width:50%}img/13/circuitsF13.6.jpg(Figure 13.6)!:img/13/circuitsF13.6.jpg
_Figure 13.6  Example Inductor Series-Parallel Reduction_

To reduce this group of inductors, first (A) recognize that the three 2µH inductors are connected in parallel, so they can be replaced by a single equivalent 2/3 µH inductor, "Figure 13.6a":#figure13-6a.


p=(#figure13-6a). !{width:50%}img/13/circuitsF13.6a.jpg(Figure 13.6a)!:img/13/circuitsF13.6a.jpg
_Figure 13.6a  First Reduction for Inductor Group_

Next (B) two inductors (the 2/3 µH and 1H) are seen to have the same current and thus are in-series.  So this series combination is just:

p=. $L_{eq}$ = $L_1$ + $L_2$

or with values;

p=. $L_{eq}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$ $\mu$H + 1H = 1H

The resultant equivalent is essentially 1H for practical purposes where 3 decimal places are sufficient because a $\mu$H is a million times smaller than a H.  The resultant equivalent circuit reduces to just two inductors, "Figure 13.6b":#figure13-6b


p=(#figure13-6b). !{width:50%}img/13/circuitsF13.6b.jpg(Figure 13.6b)!:img/13/circuitsF13.6b.jpg
_Figure 13.6b  Second Reduction of Inductor Group to Two Inductors_

And finally, (C) since these two inductors have the same voltage and are in-parallel, so their equivalent value is determined by:

p=. $L_{eq}$ = $\frac{(L_1)(L_2)}{L_1 + L_2}$

so with values:

p=. $L_{eq}$ = 4\frac{(3x10^{-6})(1)}{3x10^{-6}+1}$ = $\frac{3x10^{-6}}{1.000003}$ = 3 $\mu H$

to yield the final single inductor equivalent of 3 µH, "Figure 13.6c":#figure13-6c.


p=(#figure13-6c). !{width:45%}img/13/circuitsF13.6c.jpg(Figure 13.6c)!:img/13/circuitsF13.6c.jpg
_Figure 13.6c  Single Inductor Equivalent_

By the method of reduction for inductors, the original circuit with 5 inductors is reduced to an equivalent single inductor, at terminals A-A', of 3 $\mu H$.
