Until now the circuits we have considered have been 'static' circuits in the sense that each circuit has specific voltage and current values that _do NOT change_ when sources are fixed.  In this Section we introduce a new class of circuit elements, ones that can possess voltages and currents that may *change with time*, even during times when all sources are fixed and not changing.  We introduce two different ways that changes in voltages and currents can occur both employ new kinds of circuit elements; one uses a '_switch_', while the other uses an element that can _store and release electric energy_.

In regard to the storage and release of energy, we consider two forms of circuit elements that possess energy storage, the _capacitor_ and the _inductor_. The capacitor stores energy in an electric field, whereas the inductor stores energy in a magnetic field.  These are two different and independent forms of energy storage and they yield very different electrical current-voltage relationships at the terminals of their respective circuit elements.  We then combine energy storage elements  with switches to yield controlled time variations.

An ideal switch is a two-state two-terminal element that is either an open circuit (no current between terminals), or a short-circuit (no voltage between terminals).  When a switch is connected to our other elements it therefore causes two node terminals to be either directly connected or not.  In other words, _*the action of a switch actually changes the circuit*_.  Therefore the switch action alters the connections of the other elements in that circuit, and this means the circuit voltages and currents will also change.

In this section we confine ourselves to circuits with a _single energy storage circuit element_, either a capacitor or an inductor. Such arrangements cause either a steady increase or steady decrease in the stored energy and this yields a specific (exponential) type of time variation for circuit currents and voltages.  [Circuits that include both capacitor and inductor at the same time yield more complex results because the energy can 'swap' or 'slosh' back and forth between the two forms of energy storage.]


h4(#chapter11-switch-circuits). 11.1 - Circuits with Switch-Induced Time Variation

One means to cause a time variation in voltage and current in a circuit is to 'physically' _change the circuit_.  The new circuit element that effectively changes the circuit is an *ideal switch* = 'SW'.  An ideal switch is a two-terminal circuit element, that has _two-states_, it is either a pure 'disconnection' in other words an _open circuit_, or a pure 'connection' in other words a _short-circuit_.  This switch circuit element is depicted in "Figure 11.1":#figure11-1.

_Figure 11.1  Switch Circuit Element, Two-States: Open and Closed_

When a switch is in the *open state*: the two nodes, n1 and n2, are isolated separate nodes with no current through the switch, $i_{SW}$ = 0, called an _open-circuit_.  In contrast, when in the *closed state*: where the switch connects the two nodes n1 and n2 with no voltage difference, and hence they act as a single node. The switch closed is a _short-circuit_ and acts as any other wire in the circuit.  There is no 'in-between' state, an ideal switch is _only_ in an open or a closed position.

If we put a switch into a circuit, the result is two possible configurations. One with it open and one with it closed.  Consider the example circuit in "Figure 11.2":#figure11-2 with three resistors, one switch and one fixed voltage source.


p=(#figure11-2). !{width:95%}img/11/circuitsF11.2.jpg(Figure 11.2)!:img/11/circuitsF11.2.jpg

_Figure 11.2  Example Circuit with Switch SW, Two Circuits_

For the switch _*SW open*_ [Figure 11-2a], the response voltage $v_1$ is (by voltage divider) 12(1/2) = 6 volts.  In contrast, with the switch _*SW closed*_ [Figure 11-2b], the 6k and 3k resistors are then in parallel and the voltage divider is then changed; thus the voltage $v_1$ takes a different value of 12(1/4) = 3 volts.  The switch open or closed makes *two different circuits* and thus, accordingly, we get two different results, 6v or 3v in this case.

Switches are common elements in some circuits, most often they are used in ON/ OFF situations where they connect a power source to a circuit, think wall mounted light switch, or a camera flash circuit.  But additionally switches are used in logic circuits where they are synchronized and each connect or isolate two parts of a circuit.  When there are thousands and now-a-days millions of such switches in a circuit we make digital systems, such as microcontrollers and computers.

It is very useful to consider a circuit with a switch as one circuit with *two states*.  When the switch changes state, then the circuit response changes value.  The link to the change in value is the change in switch state.  The circuit makes an 'instantaneous' change at the exact moment the switch changes state.  "Figure 11.3":#figure11-3 shows the prior circuit of "Figure 11.2":#figure11-2, but now the switch has an identified moment in time, at t = $t_1$, when the state change occurs.  Thus we can represent the corresponding response voltage value, $v_1$, on a time axis, where $v_1$ has one value (6 volts)  for t less than $t_1$, and another value (3 volts) for t greater than $t_1$, "Figure 11.4":#figure11-4.

Now consider a circuit with a Thevenin equivalent 'source' connected to a switch and a load resistor $R_L$.  "Figure 11.5":#figure11-5 depicts the case where the switch '_closes_' at t = 0.  Here the voltage starts at zero and then increases to the 'high' state for t > 0.

"Figure 11.6":#figure11-6 depicts the same circuit, _except_ now the switch SW is *initially closed, and it opens* at t = 0.  Here observe that the output voltage starts 'high' and then drops to zero for t > 0.  The solution corresponds to the position of the switch, and the problem definition identifies the timing of the switch state.

Note that for these switched resistive circuits _all voltages and currents change *instantaneously*_ to the solution corresponding to the state of the switch.  


h4(#chapter11-energy-storage). 11.2 - Special Constraint with Circuit Elements that Possess Energy Storage

Now consider a new type of circuit element, specifically an element that can store energy _within the element itself_.  If such an 'energy-storage' element is used in our circuits, there is a fundamental change in how the circuit can respond.  We can understand this change by once again using the Thevenin source with switch circuit of "Figure 11.5":#figure11-5,  but in this case, we change the load resistor to an element that has energy storage.  This is depicted in "Figure 11.7":#figure11-7.  At this point details about the energy storage element are not needed, only that it can store energy with electric current / voltage applied at its’ terminals.


p=(#figure11-7). !{width:50%}img/11/circuitsF11.7.jpg(Figure 11.7)!:img/11/circuitsF11.7.jpg
_Figure 11.7  Switched Thevenin Source with Energy Storage Element_

What happens when the switch SW closes?  Suppose initially there is no energy in the element, when the SW closes, the element is connect to the source and current must occur in this single loop whenever $V_{th}$ ≠ $v_e$.  This implies energy must now flow into the energy storage element.  But consider the basic definition of energy as the product of power, p, times time, t:

p=. Energy = (power) x (time)
1 Joule = (1 Watt) x (1 second)
$U$ = $(p)$ $(t)$

where U is energy.  Now consider power, p, at some finite amount of power, po, then the change in energy, ∆U, is proportional to the amount of time, ∆t.
