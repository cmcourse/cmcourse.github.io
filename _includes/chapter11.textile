Until now the circuits we have considered have been 'static' circuits in the sense that each circuit has specific voltage and current values that _do NOT change_ when sources are fixed.  In this Section we introduce a new class of circuit elements, ones that can possess voltages and currents that may *change with time*, even during times when all sources are fixed and not changing.  We introduce two different ways that changes in voltages and currents can occur both employ new kinds of circuit elements; one uses a '_switch_', while the other uses an element that can _store and release electric energy_.

In regard to the storage and release of energy, we consider two forms of circuit elements that possess energy storage, the _capacitor_ and the _inductor_. The capacitor stores energy in an electric field, whereas the inductor stores energy in a magnetic field.  These are two different and independent forms of energy storage and they yield very different electrical current-voltage relationships at the terminals of their respective circuit elements.  We then combine energy storage elements  with switches to yield controlled time variations.

An ideal switch is a two-state two-terminal element that is either an open circuit (no current between terminals), or a short-circuit (no voltage between terminals).  When a switch is connected to our other elements it therefore causes two node terminals to be either directly connected or not.  In other words, _*the action of a switch actually changes the circuit*_.  Therefore the switch action alters the connections of the other elements in that circuit, and this means the circuit voltages and currents will also change.

In this section we confine ourselves to circuits with a _single energy storage circuit element_, either a capacitor or an inductor. Such arrangements cause either a steady increase or steady decrease in the stored energy and this yields a specific (exponential) type of time variation for circuit currents and voltages.  [Circuits that include both capacitor and inductor at the same time yield more complex results because the energy can 'swap' or 'slosh' back and forth between the two forms of energy storage.]


h4(#chapter11-switch-circuits). 11.1 - Circuits with Switch-Induced Time Variation

One means to cause a time variation in voltage and current in a circuit is to 'physically' _change the circuit_.  The new circuit element that effectively changes the circuit is an *ideal switch* = 'SW'.  An ideal switch is a two-terminal circuit element, that has _two-states_, it is either a pure 'disconnection' in other words an _open circuit_, or a pure 'connection' in other words a _short-circuit_.  This switch circuit element is depicted in "Figure 11.1":#figure11-1.


p=(#figure11-1). !{width:85%}img/11/circuitsF11.1.jpg(Figure 11.1)!:img/11/circuitsF11.1.jpg
_Figure 11.1  Switch Circuit Element, Two-States: Open and Closed_

When a switch is in the *open state*: the two nodes, n1 and n2, are isolated separate nodes with no current through the switch, $i_{SW}$ = 0, called an _open-circuit_.  In contrast, when in the *closed state*: where the switch connects the two nodes n1 and n2 with no voltage difference, and hence they act as a single node. The switch closed is a _short-circuit_ and acts as any other wire in the circuit.  There is no 'in-between' state, an ideal switch is _only_ in an open or a closed position.

If we put a switch into a circuit, the result is two possible configurations. One with it open and one with it closed.  Consider the example circuit in "Figure 11.2":#figure11-2 with three resistors, one switch and one fixed voltage source.


p=(#figure11-2). !{width:95%}img/11/circuitsF11.2.jpg(Figure 11.2)!:img/11/circuitsF11.2.jpg
(a) Switch SW _Open_ ........................................... (b)  Switch SW _Closed_
_Figure 11.2  Example Circuit with Switch SW, Two States and Two Circuits_

For the switch _*SW open*_ [Figure 11-2a], the response voltage $v_1$ is (by voltage divider) 12(1/2) = 6 volts.  In contrast, with the switch _*SW closed*_ [Figure 11-2b], the 6k and 3k resistors are then in parallel and the voltage divider is then changed; thus the voltage $v_1$ takes a different value of 12(1/4) = 3 volts.  The switch open or closed makes *two different circuits* and thus, accordingly, we get two different results, 6v or 3v in this case.

Switches are common elements in some circuits, most often they are used in ON/ OFF situations where they connect a power source to a circuit, think wall mounted light switch, or a camera flash circuit.  But additionally switches are used in logic circuits where they are synchronized and each connect or isolate two parts of a circuit.  When there are thousands and now-a-days millions of such switches in a circuit we make digital systems, such as microcontrollers and computers.

It is very useful to consider a circuit with a switch as one circuit with *two states*.  When the switch changes state, then the circuit response changes value.  The link to the change in value is the change in switch state.  The circuit makes an 'instantaneous' change at the exact moment the switch changes state.  "Figure 11.3":#figure11-3 shows the prior circuit of "Figure 11.2":#figure11-2, but now the switch has an identified moment in time, at t = $t_1$, when the state change occurs.  Thus we can represent the corresponding response voltage value, $v_1$, on a time axis, where $v_1$ has one value (6 volts)  for t less than $t_1$, and another value (3 volts) for t greater than $t_1$, "Figure 11.4":#figure11-4.

_Figure 11.4  Time Wave Response for Switch Closure at t = $t_1$ (from open to closed)_

Now consider a circuit with a Thevenin equivalent 'source' [comprised of voltage source $V_{th}$ and series resistance $R_{th}$] connected to a switch and a load resistor $R_L$.  "Figure 11.5":#figure11-5 depicts the case where the switch '_closes_' at t = 0.  Here the voltage starts at zero and then increases to the 'high' state for t > 0.

p=. .

Starting from the closed state "Figure 11.6":#figure11-6 depicts the same circuit, _except_ now the switch SW is *initially closed, and it opens* at t = 0.  Here observe that the output voltage starts 'high' and then drops to zero for t > 0.  The solution corresponds to the position of the switch, and the problem definition identifies the timing of the switch state.

Note that for these switched resistive circuits _all voltages and currents change *instantaneously*_ to the solution corresponding to the state of the switch.  


h4(#chapter11-energy-constraints). 11.2 - Special Constraint Energy Storage

Now consider a new type of circuit element, specifically an element that can store energy _within the element itself_.  If such an 'energy-storage' element is used in our circuits, there is a fundamental change in how the circuit can respond.  We can understand this change by once again using the Thevenin source with switch circuit of "Figure 11.5":#figure11-5,  but in this case, we change the load resistor to an element that has energy storage.  This is depicted in "Figure 11.7":#figure11-7.  At this point details about the energy storage element are not needed, only that it can store energy with electric current / voltage applied at its' terminals.


p=(#figure11-7). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.7.jpg(Figure 11.7)!:img/11/circuitsF11.7.jpg
_Figure 11.7  Switched Thevenin Source with Energy Storage Element_

What happens when the switch SW closes?  Suppose initially there is no energy in the element, when the SW closes, the element is connect to the source and current must occur in this single loop whenever $V_{th}$ $\neq$ $v_e$.  This implies energy must now flow into the energy storage element.  But consider the basic definition of energy as the product of power, $p$, times time, $t$:

p=. Energy = (power) x (time)
1 Joule = (1 Watt) x (1 second)
$U$ = $(p)$ $(t)$

where $U$ is energy.  Now consider power, $p$, at some finite amount of power, $p_0$, then the change in energy, $\Delta U$, is proportional to the amount of time, $\Delta t$.

p=. $\Delta U$ = $(p_0)$ $(\Delta t)$

Now if $\Delta t$ $\Rightarrow$ zero, in other words an instantaneous change, the  $\Delta U$ $\Rightarrow$  zero too.  This simply reveals that _we cannot change energy in something instantaneously_ !!!

<h3>
p=. *It takes time to change energy !* </h3>


h4(#chapter11-capacitor-element). 11.3 - Capacitor, an Energy Storage Circuit Element

Consider a specific kind of energy-storage circuit element, the capacitor.  This is a two-terminal element and has the circuit symbol and circuit constraint depicted in "Figure 11.8":#figure11-8.


p=(#figure11-8). !{width:45%}img/11/circuitsF11.8.jpg(Figure 11.8)!:img/11/circuitsF11.8.jpg
_Figure 11.8  Capacitor Symbol and Capacitor Constraint_

The capacitor element symbol uses the same polarity convention used by all our circuit elements; positive current is _directed toward_ the positive polarity of the element voltage.  The basic circuit constraint for a capacitor is unusual for us because it relates the _charge_ held by the capacitor as a constant times the capacitor voltage.  The constant is called the _capacitance_, $C$.  The units are charge in Coulombs, capacitance in Farads, and voltage in Volts.  To relate this constraint to a voltage and current relationship we add the *basic definition* of current as the time derivative of charge:

p=. $i$ = $\frac{dQ}{dt}$

hence, for the capacitor:

p=. $i_C$ = $\frac{dQ_C}{dt}$ = $\frac{d}{dt}[CV_C]$

by differentiation by parts:

p=. $i_C$ = $C\frac{d}{dt}[V_C]$ = $V_C\frac{d}{dt}$ $C$

but in our circuits capacitance $C$ is a constant and hence the 2nd term is zero, so the capacitor circuit element current-voltage constraint is:

p=. $i_C(t)$ = $C\frac{d}{dt}V_C(t)$

This means the capacitor element current, $i_C$, is proportional to the _time derivative_ of the capacitor voltage, $v_C$.  This is a new type of constraint in that current depends upon the _*rate* that the voltage changes_ and not on the voltage value itself.  Notice if there is no time variation, meaning the capacitor voltage is constant, then the derivative is zero.  Hence, _under constant no-variation (*equilibrium*) conditions the capacitor current is zero, an open circuit_.

Additionally, a capacitor stores energy with a value, $U_C$, of: [Derived from $U$ = $p$ * $t$]

p=. $U_C (t)$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ $C$ $V_C^2$$(t)$

Notice, the stored energy in a capacitor depends on the capacitance value, but more importantly also on the _capacitor voltage_, $V_C$.  Now consider the constraint on any energy storage element where the energy cannot change instantaneously.  Hence we find there is an _added constraint_ for capacitors: _the capacitor voltage *cannot* change instantaneously__, which means _the capacitor voltage must be *continuous* with variation over time_.

p=. Capacitor Energy Constraint is: $\Rightarrow$ $V_C(t)$ is *always continuous.*

We will find that this requirement for voltage continuity on a capacitor is very significant, especially for switched circuits.  The voltage on a capacitor must be the same immediately before to immediately after a switch closes or opens.

** _*11.3.1 Capacitor-Current Waveform Example*_

Since the time derivative represents the instantaneous slope, we can find the capacitor current given we know the time waveform of the capacitor voltage.  This derivative relationship is depicted in "Figure 11.9":#figure11-9, which shows an example with given voltage waveform and the corresponding resultant current for a capacitor of 3 Farads.


p=(#figure11-9). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.9.jpg(Figure 11.9)!:img/11/circuitsF11.9.jpg
_Figure 11.9  Example Voltage and Current Waveforms for a Capacitor of 3 Farads_

This current waveform can be calculated by considering each of 5 distinct regions of constant slope in the given voltage waveform, as discussed below.

## In the time interval: $t < 0$: The capacitor voltage is given to be a constant value (zero in this case, but it is constant), and hence the capacitor current, iC, is zero.
## In the time interval: $0 < t < 1$ second: The capacitor voltage is changing at a constant rate of slope 5 volts / 1 sec, and hence the capacitor current is 3 x 5 = 15 amperes.
## In the time interval: $1 < t < 3$ second: The capacitor voltage is a fixed constant of 5 volts, and hence the time derivative is zero, so the capacitor current is zero.
## In the time interval: $3 < t < 5$ second: The capacitor voltage is again changing, this time it is reducing at a constant rate of -5 volts in 2 seconds, and hence the capacitor current is 3 x (-5/2) = -7.5 amperes.
## In the time interval: $t > 5$ second: The capacitor voltage is again given to be constant so the current is again zero.

Notice the derivative relation means the current is a constant when the slope of the voltage versus time is a constant. At a voltage slope of +5 volts/sec, the current in this case is a constant 15 amperes.  And for a voltage slope of - 5/2 volts/sec, the element current is - 15/2 amperes.

Hence, the element constraint relation for a capacitor causes a very different relationship between the voltage across the capacitor and the corresponding element current through the capacitor.  Unlike a resistor element (where the voltage and current are proportional and have the same 'shape' of time variation) the capacitor forces a time varying element current to have a very different 'shape' or form compared to the element voltage.  There is a relationship of course, the current is proportional to the derivative-in-time of the voltage, but this constraint causes the current waveform to 'look' different than the voltage waveform, see "Figure 11.9":#figure11-9 above as an example.


h4(#chapter11-switched-RC). 11.4 - Resistor-Capacitor Switched Circuits, Transient Time Response

At this point we now combine the various circuit elements into a circuit and determine an entirely new response, one where energy storage strongly influences the voltages and currents.  To understand this energy storage effect we consider a Thevenin-like circuit connected to a single capacitor, "Figure 11.10":#figure11-10.


p=(#figure11-10). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.10.jpg(Figure 11.10)!:img/11/circuitsF11.10.jpg
_Figure 11.10  Resistor-Capacitor Series Circuit with Switch_

This series connection of fixed voltage source, $V_S$, and resistor, $R$, that may also be considered as a Thevenin equivalent circuit for a more complex network.  Hence, this simple RC circuit represents a more complex problem where the complex linear circuit surrounding a capacitor is represented by its' Thevenin equivalent.  Here the capacitor voltage and current are identified, $v_C(t)$ and $i_C(t)$, and the resistor voltage and current, $v_R(t)$ and $i_R(t)$, are also identified.  We can proceed to solve this switched RC circuit by direct application of element and circuit _constraints_, according to the switch position.

*Before: $t$ = 0, with the switch open:*
The capacitor current, $i_C$, must be zero since there is no connected path to any other elements.  But zero capacitor current (by the capacitor constraint) requires a constant capacitor voltage, $v_C(t)$ = constant.  The value of this constant voltage will be set by any prior connections to the capacitor, and for now is taken to be zero, $v_C(t=0-)$ = 0.

*At: t = 0+, just after the switch closes:*
By the energy constraint, the capacitor voltage _cannot change instantaneously_, and thus:

p=. $v_C(t=0+)$ = $v_C(t=0-)$ = 0

*After: t = 0: further after the switch closure:*
Element constraints require the voltage across the resistor to be $v_R$ = ($V_S$ – $v_C$), and thus by ohm's law and KCL we can write:

p=. $i_R(t)$ = $\frac{(V_S - v_C(t))}{R}$ = $i_C(t)$

Here we recognize that the circuit has a single loop so the resistor current, $i_R$, must equal the capacitor current $i_C$.  Additionally, the constraint relation for a capacitor requires:

p=. $i_C(t)$ = $C\frac{d}{dt}V_C(t)$

equating; we obtain:

p=. $C\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$ = $\frac{(V_S - v_C(t))}{R}$

collecting terms:

p=. $\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$ + $\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t)$ = $\frac{V_S}{RC}$ ... [Eq'n 1]

This equation is a _differential equation_, and more specifically it is a Linear, Constant Coefficient Differential Equation of first order.  Hence in 'short-hand' it is a 1st-order LCCDE.  It describes the capacitor voltage for all time greater than zero (after the switch is closed).  The corresponding generic form for a _capacitor voltage in a switched circuit_ is:

p=. $\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$ + $\frac{1}{\tau}v_C(t)$ = $K$ (= constant) ... [Eq'n 2]

where, the constant tau, $\tau$ , must have the units of time to match the units of the derivative term, so   ($\tau$) = $RC$ (ohm-farads = seconds).  All three terms in equation 2 here have units of volts/sec.

This LCCDE has a general solution of the form:

p=. $v_C(t)$ = A$e^\frac{-t}{\tau}$ + B ... [Eq'n 3]

The exponential term is inherent to ALL 1st order LCCDE systems and is often referred to as the '*homogeneous*' part of the solution.  In this case the second term, the constant B, is selected to match the drive, which in this case is a constant.  This second term of the general solution is often referred to as the '*particular*' part of the solution, since it is chosen to match the equation form of the drive of the problem.  To better understand the exponential relation, we first graphically depict the exponential function "Figure 11.11":#figure11-11.


p=(#figure11-11). !{width:80%}img/11/circuitsF11.11.jpg(Figure 11.11)!:img/11/circuitsF11.11.jpg
_Figure 11.11  The Exponential Decay Function_

Notice the units of time, t, are in tau, ($\tau$ ).  At time t = 0 the value of the exponential function is $e^0$ = 1, and at t = 1 tau the value has decayed to $e^{-1}$ = 0.368 (36.8%).  And by 3 tau the value of the exponential is just $e^{-3}$ = 0.0498  (5% of the initial value at t = 0); at 5 tau the value is $e^{-5}$ = 0.0067, less than 1% the value at t = 0.  As a practical matter, we often identify the completion of the exponential transient decay to be at the time of 5 tau.  We cannot wait forever and hence take the practical answer of essentially negligible remaining change.  Hence this selected end point of _5 tau_ corresponds to our 'completed' transient (and is accurate to within an error of less than 1%).

Notice also the initial slope of the exponential decay is the _tangent line_ at t = 0 that goes through the final value = 0, time axis, at a time of 1 tau.  This makes graphing the exponential relatively easy since *all exponential decays* take exactly this shape.

** _*11.4.1 Convenient Form for the Universal Switch Response Solution*_

A 'universal' response characteristic for all switched capacitive circuits can be obtained by starting from the switch response solution form of Eq'n 3 and then evaluate two extremes, one at t = 0+, and the other when the transient is fully over at t = $\infty$.  At time t = 0+ the exponential term is 1, and hence the LCCDE solution has the value of:

p=. $v_C(0)$ = A + B = $v_{Cinit}$

and at t = $\infty$, the exponential term is zero so:

p=. $v_C(\infty)$ = B = $v_{Cfnl}$

Thus, if we express the exponential decay as beginning at t = 0 with value of $v_{Cinitial}$, and the decay ending with a value of $v_{Cfinal}$, we can rewrite Eq'n 3 as Eq'n 4.

p=. $v_C(t)$ = $(v_{Cinit} - v_{Cfnl})$ $e^\frac{-t}{\tau}$ + $v_{Cfnl}$ ... [eq'n 4]

This *general solution* expresses a full range of possible solutions for Switched $RC$ circuits.  Consider the cases where the final value is smaller than the initial value, 'falling' curve 'A'; and where the final value is larger than the initial value, 'rising' curve 'B' as depicted in "Figure 11.12":#figure11-12.


p=(#figure11-12). !{width:80%}img/11/circuitsF11.12.jpg(Figure 11.12)!:img/11/circuitsF11.12.jpg
_Figure 11.12  Rising  and Falling Cases of Exponential Transient Time Responses_

Notice the time variation is always the same, a simple 'exponential-in-time' relation.  The responses are either increasing or decreasing, but the time variation 'shape' is the same just the simple exponential, $e^\frac{-t}{\tau}$ .

** _*11.4.2  Example Exponential Time Response Curves*_

Lets consider a couple of numerical cases of the exponential response.  If the _initial value_ of an exponential response for voltage $v_C(t)$ for time, $t$ > 0, is 12 volts and the _final value_ is -4 volts, and the _time-constant_ tau is 3 seconds, then the equation for the response is:

p=. $v_C(0)$ = $[12 - (-4)]$ $e^{\frac{-t}{3}}$ + $(-4)$ ... for $t$ > 0

p=. $v_C(0)$ = $(16)$ $e^\frac{-t}{3}$ - $4$ ... for $t$ > 0

This response starts at a high value and decays to a lower value and thus is of the form of 'falling' curve 'A' in "Figure 11.12":#figure11-12.

Another example response (valid for $t$ > 0) could have an _initial value_ of +5 volts, a _final value_ of +14 volts, with a _time-constant_ tau = 5 seconds.  The response equation is then:

p=. $v_C(0)$ = $[5 - (14)]$ $e^\frac{-t}{3}$ + $(14)$ ... for $t$ > 0

so, reducing:

p=. $v_C(0)$ = $(-9)$ $e^\frac{-t}{3}$ - $14$ ... for $t$ > 0

This response starts at a lower initial value of +5 and ends higher at the final value of +14 and thus is of the form of 'rising' curve 'B' in "Figure 11.12":#figure11-12.


h4(#chapter11-example-switchedRC). 11.5 - Example Resistor-Capacitor Switched Circuits

We can apply our transient solution method to the switched R-C (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit problem.  Using the basic structure of "Figure 11.10":#figure11-10 with numerical values consider the circuit in "Figure 11.13":#figure11-13, we desire to determine the output voltage $v_{out(t)}$ for $t$ > 0.


p=(#figure11-13). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.13.jpg(Figure 11.13)!:img/11/circuitsF11.13.jpg
_Figure 11.13  Example Switched R-C Circuit_

To solve this problem we also need to know the initial value of the capacitor voltage _just before_ the switch closes at $t$ = 0.  Assume that it is given that just _before_ $t$ = 0 we know $v_{out(0-)}$ = 0.  Then, since the _energy constraint_ for a capacitor requires a continuous capacitor voltage, so therefore just after $t$ = 0, the value $v_{out(0+)}$ must also be zero.  This $t$ = 0+ value of zero is the _*initial*_ value of the output voltage response.

Additionally, we need to know the final value of the output voltage.  To find this we need to recognize that the final value means there is no further change, in other words the circuit is in _equilibrium_.  But 'equilibrium' means all $d/dt$ (time derivative) terms must be zero, since *nothing is changing in equilibrium*.  Since $dv_C/dt$, this means there can be no current ( iC = C dvC/dt ) in a capacitor at equilibrium.  For our circuit in "Figure 11.13":#figure11-13, ($t$ > 0), zero capacitor current also means no resistor current, and thus no voltage across the resistor.  By application of KVL, the _final value_ of the output voltage must be the same as the fixed voltage source, 8 volts.

From Eq'n 1 and Eq'n 2 the _time-constant_ tau is the product $RC$, and this is value for our circuit is 3000 x 2 = 6000 seconds.  We now apply our specific values to our general solution of Eq’n 4, and get:

p=. $v_{out}(t)$ = $[0-(8)]$ $e^{\frac{-t}{6000}}$ + $(8)$ ... for $t$ > 0

or

p=. $v_{out}(t)$ = $-8$ $e^{\frac{-t}{6000}}$ + 8 ... for $t$ > 0

The graphical plot versus time for this switched circuit output voltage is shown in "Figure 11.14":#figure11-14 and is a rinsing response (of the type 'B' curve).  The final value is attained in 5 time constants = 30,000 seonds.

_Figure 11.14  Output Voltage Response of Example RC Circuit_


h4(#chapter11-thevenin-switchedRC). 11.6 - Thevenin Equivalent Switched R-C Circuits

The solution process we just used in the above example can now be extended to more complex circuits with a single capacitor.  The way to solve more complex circuits is to apply the Thevenin equivalent _*as seen by the capacitor*_ to reduce the complex circuit to the same form as in "Figure 11.10":#figure11-10.

To better understand this process let consider an example where there are multiple resistors.  An example circuit for such a situation is shown in "Figure 11.15":#figure11-15.


p=(#figure11-15). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.15.jpg(Figure 11.15)!:img/11/circuitsF11.15.jpg
_Figure 11.15  Complex Switched R-C Circuit Example_

This circuit is assumed to have the switch SW _open_ for a long period of time, prior to $t$ = 0.  Hence the circuit is in _equilibrium_ at $t$ = $0-$.  Because in equilibrium (with the switch open) the capacitor has zero current, so $v_{out}(t=0-)$ is the source voltage 9 volts, "Figure 11.16":#figure11-16.  This is the 'initial value' for our solution.


p=(#figure11-16). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.16.jpg(Figure 11.16)!:img/11/circuitsF11.16.jpg
_Figure 11.16  Equivalent Circuit for 'Initial Value' Calculation, Switch Open_

Next we calculate the 'final value' of the output voltage with the switch closed.  The 'at equilibrium' circuit with closed switch is therefore in "Figure 11.17":#figure11-17. This circuit is a simple voltage divider and yield $v_{out}(t = \infty)$ = (2/3)9 = 6 volts.


p=(#figure11-17). !{width:60%}img/11/circuitsF11.17.jpg(Figure 11.17)!:img/11/circuitsF11.17.jpg
_Figure 11.17  Equivalent Circuit for 'Final Value' Calculation, Switch Closed_

And finally we calculate the time-constant.  But from Eq'n 2 and Eq'n 3 the equivalent  ‘resistance’ value in the time-constant RC calculation is the Thevenin equivalent resistance as seen by the capacitor.  To find the Thevenin equivalent resistance at the terminals of the capacitor we set all independent sources to zero, so the equivalent resistance circuit is just the 3k and 6k in parallel, and therefore Rth is 2k, "Figure 11.18":#figure11-18.

Combining these three values of _*initial*_ (9 volts), _*final*_ (6 volts) and _*time-constant*_ (2000 x 2x10-6) we obtain the equation for $v_{out}(t)$ for $t$ > 0 as;

p=. $v_{out}(t)$ = $[6-(6)]$ $e^{\frac{-t}{4x10^{-3}}}$ + $(6)$ ... for $t$ > 0

or

p=. $v_{out}(t)$ = $3$ $e^{\frac{-t}{4x10^{-3}}}$ + 6 ... for $t$ > 0

Graphically this solution is:

Notice from this above example we see a useful general method to solve switched $R-C$ circuit problems.   There are three basic unknowns; (1) the initial value, (2) the final value and (3) the time constant.  These values are then applied to the general form of solution, Eq'n 4, to get the resultant time response answer.

The inherent exponential form for the $RC$ solution takes care of all the remaining time variation of the solution. To achieve a reliable answer for these three constants it often is _a good idea to make three separate equivalent circuits_, one for each of the three conditions: initial, final and time-constant.  The prior example is an illustration of this process.  It also helps understand why the solution has the features that it contains since you get to see how each value is produced and what part of the circuit influences the outcome.

A switch element can also be part of a a circuit with an operational amplifier.  An example of such a circuit is depicted in "Figure 11.20":#figure11-20.

Here the $RC$ transient response occurs before the input to the operational amplifier.  Furthermore this particular opamp configuration with non-inverting structure connects to the positive input of the opamp and therefore draws no current from the $RC$ portion of the circuit.  Hence in this case the $RC$ transient develops entirely independent from the opamp portion of the circuit.

The $RC$ transient is the result of the 6 volt source, the 3k and 6k resistors and the 3 microfarad capacitor.  The voltage on the capacitor provides the input to the non-inverting amplifier that has a gain of: (1k + 3k) / (1k) = +4.

The transient response has an _initial value_ of $0$ volts (the 6k resistor casues a zero initial capacitor voltage), a _final value_ of (6) / (3+6) x 6 volts = 4 volts (due the voltage divider configuration of these two resistors), and a _time-constant_ of (3k || 6k) x 3 $\mu$F = 6 milliseconds (due to the net 2k equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor).  This result is amplified x4 by the non-inverting amplifier, and hence the result is the rising exponential response that starts at $t$ = 0 as depicted in "Figure 11.20":#figure11-20.

The switched $RC$ circuit response is inherently a transition from an initial state to a final state.  The rate of transition is dependent upon the effective time-constant of the capacitor and the equivalent resistance  at the capacitor terminals.
