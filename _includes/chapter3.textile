We have seen that all circuit elements have nodes to contact the element.  Now in this section we consider what happens when two or more elements are connected together.  To connect two elements together we can start by connecting one end of 2 different elements to the same node.  For example, in "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 a fixed voltage source and a resistor are shown connected together at one end, at node n_1.

For this ‘circuit’ of Figure 3.1 we could write the two element constitutive relations as:

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n3}) - i_R R = 0$

So now we have 5 variables ($v_{n1}$, $v_{n2}$, $v_{n3}$, and $i_R$ and $i_S$), but only 2 equations.  [The source and resistor constant values are known, $V_S$ and $R$.] There are too many variables to solve with only 2 equations!  We need more constraints to relate the variables.

However, first of all notice, "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 is not actually a circuit !  There is *not* a closed loop. So to make a circuit we need _at least one closed loop_.  Lets make a loop by connecting node n2 and node n3 to yield a single node n2.  This circuit is shown in "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2.

_Figure 3.2  Voltage Source and Resistor Connected to the Same Two Nodes: n1 and n2_

Now for this circuit of "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2 we write the respective two element constitutive relations as:

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - i_R R = 0$

So now we have 4 variables ($v_{n1}$, $v_{n2}$, and $i_R$ and $i_S$), but again _only two equations_ !!!  [The source and resistor constant values are known, $V_S$ and $R$.]  We still cannot solve.  This is where 'Rule-2' comes to the rescue in the form of Kirchoff's Current Law.

h4(#chapter3-KCL). 3.1 - Kirchoff’s Current Law

We now find an extra constraint not due to the elements themselves ('Rule-1' type constraints) because we already have those as expressed by the constitutive relations. Rather we need a new type of constraint, one associated with the _interconnections_ of circuit elements, a 'Rule-2' type constraint.

These new 'Rule-2' constraints come from physical limits which the real world imposes on our circuits.  In particular, recall that charges cannot be created nor destroyed, so currents cannot just end in mid-air.  In other words, currents cannot just cease at a node.  This fact is expressed by _Kirchoff's Current Law_, which simply states that _the sum of all branch currents leaving a node must be zero_.  We can write this law in equation form "Eq'n. 3.1":#eq3-1., for any node with 'm' branches:

p=(#eq3-1). $Sum of all 'm' branch currents i_j must = 0$ where $i_j$ is the branch current _leaving_ the node on branch '$j$'

where, the currents $i_j$ are the m branch currents that leave the node.  This constraint can be illustrated by a 4-branch node example, as shown in "Figure 3.3":#figure3-3,

p=(#figure3-3). !{width:30%}img/3/circuitsF3.3a.jpg(Figure 3.3)!:img/3/circuitsF3.3a.jpg
_Figure 3.3  Kirchoff’s Current Law Applied at an Example 4-Branch Node_

and the corresponding Kirchoff’s Current Law "Eq'n. 3.2":#eq3-2.

p=(#eq3-2). $(i_1 - i_2 + i_3 + i_4) = 0$  Eq'n 3.2

Notice that there is a negative sign '$-i_2$' in this equation.  Recall we must sum all the currents _leaving_ the node, but '$i_2$' is defined by the current arrow as entering, so therefore '$-i_2$' is the current leaving via branch 2.  Also notice that "Figure 3.3":#figure3-3 is just a portion of a complete circuit that is not fully shown.  The current $i_4$ in resistor $R_4$ cannot disappear into no-where, and the same for the other branch currents.  There must be more of the circuit not depicted in "Figure 3.3":#figure3-3.  So a key point of this is that Kirchoff’s Current Law applies to *_any node_* independent of the remainder of the circuit, so it is completely accurate to write "Eq'n. 3.2":#eq3-2 with only the local knowledge at that node, and without knowledge of other parts of the circuit.

So as another example lets apply the Kirchoff’s Current Law constraint to node-1 of our 2-element circuit of "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2 above, hence we collect the two forms of constraints (constitutive, and Kirchoff) as follows:

_Constitutive Relations:_

p=. $Fixed Voltage Source: (V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

p=. $Resistor: (V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - i_R R = 0$

_Kirchoff's Current Law:_

p=. $i_S + i_R = 0$		 

And finally, as a practical matter most all circuits have a reference voltage.  Namely one of the nodes is selected to be at the reference voltage, usually set at zero volts.  Thus in this case we may select the node n2 to be the reference and set it to zero.

p=. $i_{n2} = 0$		 

Together these equations can be solved to yield the solution:

p=. $v_{n1} = V_S$

p=. $v_{n2} = 0$

p=. $i_R = V_S/R$

p=. $i_S = -i_R = -V_S/R$

If we apply numerical values and use a fixed voltage source of 5 volts, and a resistor with resistance value of 3 ohms, then the solution would be:

p=. $v_{n1} = 5 volts$

p=. $v_{n2} = 0$

p=. $i_R = 5/3 = 1.67 ampere$

p=. $i_S = -1.67 ampere$

The power dissipated in each element can be calculated from these voltages and currents.
In the resistor:

p=. $P_R = (5volts)(5/3amp) = 25/3 = 8.33 watt$

and in the fixed voltage source:

p=. $P_S = (5volt)(-5/3amp) = -25/3 = -8.33 watt$


h4(#chapter3-KVL). 3.1 - Kirchoff’s Voltage Law

There is another constraint, one that is again associated with the interconnections of circuit elements, another 'Rule-2' type constraint.  And again this constraint is caused by the restrictions imposed by our physical world.  In this case we are concerned with potential energy, this is just a more general term for the quantity in our circuits we call *voltage*.  Voltage in our circuits is a _conserved_ quantity and is associated with any node.  Conservation of energy means the value of voltage at any node is _always the same independent of the path taken to get to the node_.

Being conserved, means that if a node 'A' is at a voltage $V_A$, then if we follow any circuit loop and return back to node 'A' the voltage must be the same voltage value $V_A$.  In other words, the sum of all element voltages around any closed circuit loop path MUST BE ZERO.  This fact is an expression of Kirchoff’s Voltage Law, and is written in the form of "Eq'n. 3.3":#eq3-3.

p=(#eq3-3). $Sum of all 'm' element voltages v_j around a closed loop must = 0$ where $v_j$ is the branch voltage _drop_ across element '$j$'
