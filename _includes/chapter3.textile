We have seen that all circuit elements have nodes to contact the element.  Now in this section we consider what happens when two or more elements are connected together.  To connect two elements together we can start by connecting one end of 2 different elements to the same node.  For example, in "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 a fixed voltage source and a resistor are shown connected together at one end, at node n_1.

For this ‘circuit’ of Figure 3.1 we could write the constitutive relations as:

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

And:

p=. $(V_{n1} - V_{n3}) - i_R R = 0$

So now we have 5 variables ($v_{n1}$, $v_{n2}$, $v_{n3}$, and $i_R$ and $i_S$), but only 2 equations.  We cannot solve with 2 equations!  We need more constraints to relate the variables.

However, first of all notice, "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 is not actually a circuit !  There is *not* a closed loop. So to make a circuit we need _at least one closed loop_.  Lets make a loop by connecting node n2 and node n3 to yield a single node n2.  This circuit is shown in "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2.

Now for this circuit of "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2 we write the respective two constitutive relations as "Eq'n. 3.2":#eq3-2.:

p=(#eq3-2). $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

And:

p=(#eq3-2). $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - i_R R = 0$

So now we have 4 variables ($v_{n1}$, $v_{n2}$, and $i_R$ and $i_S$), but again _only two equations_ !!!  [The source and resistor constant values are known, $V_S$ and $R$.]  We still cannot solve.  This is where 'Rule-2' comes to the rescue in the form of Kirchoff's Current Law.

These new 'Rule-2' constraints come from physical limits which the real world imposes on our circuits.  In particular, recall that charges cannot be created nor destroyed, so currents cannot just end in mid-air.  In other words, currents cannot just cease at a node.  This fact is expressed by _Kirchoff's Current Law_, which simply states that _the sum of all branch currents leaving a node must be zero_.  We can write this law in equation form "Eq'n. 3.1":#eq3-1., for any node:

p=(#eq3-1). $Sum of all branch currents i_j (connected to the node) must = 0$ where $i_j$ is the branch current _leaving_ the node on branch '$j$'
