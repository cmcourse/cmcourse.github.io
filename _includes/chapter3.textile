We have seen that all circuit elements have nodes to contact the element.  Now in this section we consider what happens when two or more elements are connected together.  To connect two elements together we can start by connecting one end of 2 different elements to the same node.  For example, in "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 a fixed voltage source and a resistor are shown connected together at one end, at node n_1.

For this ‘circuit’ of Figure 3.1 we could write the constitutive relations as "Eq'n. 3.1":#eq3-1.:

p=(#eq3-1). $(V_{n1} - V_{n2}) - V_S = 0$

And:#eq3-2

p=(#eq3-2). $(V_{n1} - V_{n3}) - i_R R = 0$

So now we have 5 variables ($v_{n1}$, $v_{n2}$, $v_{n3}$, and $i_R$ and $i_S$), but only 2 equations.  We cannot solve with 2 equations!  We need more constraints to relate the variables.

However, first of all notice, "Figure 3.1":#figure3-1 is not actually a circuit !  There is *not* a closed loop. So to make a circuit we need _at least one closed loop_.  Lets make a loop by connecting node n2 and node n3 to yield a single node n2.  This circuit is shown in "Figure 3.2":#figure3-2.
