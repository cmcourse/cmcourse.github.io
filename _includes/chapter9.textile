At this point we introduce a key concept that enables valuable simplifications for circuit analysis and design, it is called _*linearity*_.  Linearity represents an important new constraint associated with our circuit elements.  While much of the real world is in fact actually _non-linear_, fortunately, in many cases we can _consider real circuit elements to be linear_ and thereby greatly simplify our analysis and design of circuits.

Lets consider our total physical world and then further confine ourselves to electrical circuits, so this new linearity restriction represents a sub-set of all circuits, "Figure 9.1":#figure9-1.

We will see in this Section exactly how linearity provides such a powerful opportunity for engineers, and especially circuit engineers.  Additionally, with linearity a major new solution method becomes possible, called _*superposition*_.  Complex problems can be greatly simplified with linearity.  And then finally in this Section we examine a new means to represent linear circuits in a highly 'compressed' format, achieved via _Thevenin_ and _Norton_ theorems.  With these theorems, circuits of hundreds, even thousands of elements will be compressed to just two elements.  Thus this Section brings very powerful methods that enable engineers to tackle immensely complex problems.

h4(#chapter9-linearity). 9.1 - Linearity

At this time we will formally introduce an added constraint that is to apply to all the elements we may use in circuits in this course.  This new constraint concerns an added property of circuits.  It is called _linearity_.  Here we mean linear in a 'systems' sense.  As we will see, this is more restrictive than the idea of a linear graph, which refers to any straight-line graph.  In our case for linear circuits we need to apply a more specific constraint, one that ensures there is a highly predictable output (also called a 'response') for an applied input (also sometimes called the 'drive').  We will use a very specific and concise definition for linearity.  Because of the power of the linearity constraint we will see that a circuit comprised of all linear circuit elements will also be linear.

p=. _(i) Definitions_

Here we will define a 'linear' system as one that satisfies two properties:

** 	(1) the _homogeneity property_,   where:   f(ax)=af(x) for all real a, and

** 	(2) the _additivity property_,        where:   f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)

In words, these two properties mean:

## If we apply double the input, then the response must also double. Notice when input x is zero, then output f(x) must also be zero.
## The response for two simultaneous inputs applied at the same time is the same result as for the two inputs applied separately and their individual responses added together.  The additivity property is often in circuits referred to as superposition.

** 9.1.1 Implications and Understandiing

A linear circuit element is one where the current-voltage relation for that element is restricted to being linear in the above definition.

This linearity is DIFFERENT from simple algebra polynomials, which refer to *any* straight line as 'linear'.  For example, y= mx+b.  However, for the discussion of a linear operation, then a typical straight line *does NOT satisfy our definition of linearity* because a non-zero constant 'b' means when we double x, we do not double y.

All three of *our circuit elements* discussed so far (resistors, fixed voltage, and fixed current sources) *are 'linear' elements*. For example with the resistor:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}R$ = 0

So if the resistor element voltage, ($v_{n1}-v_{n2}), is doubled then the current $i_R$ must also double, since $R$ is a constant, which does not change with voltage or current.  As an example of a non-linear circuit element, if the resistance $R$ *did change with voltage*, then the element would NOT be linear.  For example, suppose we had an element where the 'resistance' increased with current, $R = k iR$.  Then the constraint equation would become:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}(kR)$ = $(v_{n1} - v_{n2})$-$ki_R^2$ = 0

Now if the element voltage (vn1-vn2) doubled, the current iR would NOT double, due to the ‘square’ term.  This fictitious element is NOT linear.  "Figure 9.2":#figure9-2 shows the i-v characteristic for this type of non-linearity.  Notice the graph is not a straight line, it is non-linear.  In this course all elements we use are linear.
 
p=(#figure9-2). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.2.jpg(Figure 9.2)!:img/9/circuitsF9.2.jpg
_Figure 9.2  Example Non-Linear i-v Characteristic_

Both the fixed voltage source and the fixed current sources are also linear.  This is because when you double the size of the source voltage, $V_S$, the element voltage doubles.  Similarly for the fixed current source, if we double the size of the source current, $I_S$, then, the element current also doubles.

A very important property of linearity is that a circuit comprised entirely of linear elements results in a complete circuit that is also linear.  This is because our conservation laws of KCL and KVL do not violate linearity.  To illustrate, consider the circuit of "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3.  Here we can calculate that the 10 volt voltage source causes a resistor current, $I_B$, of 1/2 milliamp.
 
p=(#figure9-3). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.3.jpg(Figure 9.3)!:img/9/circuitsF9.3.jpg
_Figure 9.3  Example Linear Circuit_

If the voltage source in "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3 is changed to double value, 20 volts, then $I_B$ also is seen to double to 1mA.  And if the voltage source is reduced all the way to zero, the response, $I_B$, would be zero.  This circuit is comprised of linear elements and it yields a linear response with respect to the input sources.  This circuit is a linear system.

h4(#chapter9-superposition). 9.2 - Superposition Method

When we have a linear system, we can apply a solution method called the _superposition method_.  Superposition fails if the system is NOT linear.  So linearity is a _necessary condition_ to be able to apply the superposition method.

For the superposition method, consider we have a network of many linear resistors and multiple linear sources.  Furthermore, we draw this circuit by bringing all the sources to an ‘exterior’ (visible) part of the circuit.  This is illustrated in "Figure 9.4":#figure9-4.
 
p=(#figure9-4). !{width:65%}img/9/circuitsF9.4.jpg(Figure 9.4)!:img/9/circuitsF9.4.jpg
_Figure 9.4  Circuit of Linear Resistors and Linear Sources._

In this illustration we have a circuit of 8 resistors, 4 voltage sources, and 2 current sources.  Although connected, the actual circuit node connections are not depicted because they are not needed for this discussion.  Also explicitly identified for this illustration are a voltage, $V_{R7}$, across resistor $R_7$; and a current, $I_{R3}$, in resistor $R_3$.

We can write an expression for the voltage across resistor $R_7$ as:

p=. $V_{R7}$ = $a_1 V_{S1} + a_2 V_{S2} + a_3 V_{S3} + a_4 V_{S4} + b_1 I_{S1} + b_2 I_{S2}$

where, all the 'a' and 'b' values are fixed constants for the given circuit.  In other words, the voltage on resistor $R_7$, (and in fact on any resistor in the circuit or for any current in the circuit), is a sum of six terms, each a fixed constant times a source quantity.  These 'a' and 'b' constants are fixed and determined by the circuit connections, resistor values and which voltage or current is being calculated.  These constants _do not depend_ on the value of the source voltages, $V_{Sn}$,  or source currents, $I_{Sn}$.

We could also write a corresponding equation for the current $i_{R3}$.  Indeed as well as for any voltage or any current in our circuit.  Thus, we will always find that any voltage or any current is calculated as a sum of terms with each source contributing some portion to the total sum of terms.

Now we *take the HUGE leap*, one that is permitted explicitly because of the additivity property of linearity. Instead of having all sources ON at the same time, lets make a 'thought' experiment where we turn on ONLY ONE SOURCE AT A TIME, and ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE 'SET-TO-ZERO'.  Hence in the above case, when we have ONLY voltage source VS1 ON (the other 5 sources are set-to-zero), so the resistor $R_7$ voltage would be:

p=. $V_{R7-1}$ = $a_1 V_{S1} + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0$  .....  so  .....  $V_{R7}$ = $a_1 V_{S1}$

We see, because all other sources are set-to-zero, the only non-zero contribution is from a1VS1.  Similarly, for ONLY voltage source $V_{S2}$ ON, all other sources set-to-zero:

p=. $V_R7-2}$ = $a_2 V_{S2}$

and for ONLY voltage sources VS3 and VS4 ON individually, others set-to-zero:

p=. $V_{R7-3}$ = 

and for ONLY current sources IS1 and IS2 ON individually, others set-to-zero:

p=. $V_{R7-5}$ =

Notice when we add _all 6 of these individual calculations_ they yield exactly the same answer as if all sources were ON at the same time.  In other words, by activating one source at a time _with all other sources 'set-to-zero'_, then the summation of these individual responses, yields the response of the entire circuit with all sources ON.

We have taken a complex multi-source problem and reduced it to the summation of single-source problems.  This is called the SUPERPOSITION METHOD.

** 9.2.1 Example #1: Solution by Superposition Method

Consider the circuit of "Figure 9.5":#figure9-5.  It has two voltage sources and 3 resistors and we seek to calculate the output voltage Vout.

_Figure 9.5  Example Two-Source Circuit_

This is a linear circuit; hence we can apply the method of superposition.  We make two separate circuits: one with 8 volt ON and 12 volt SET-TO-ZERO; and the other with 12 volt ON and 8 volt SET-TO-ZERO, as depicted in "Figure 9.6":#figure9-6.
