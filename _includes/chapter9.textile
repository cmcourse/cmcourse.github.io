At this point we introduce a key concept that enables valuable simplifications for circuit analysis and design, it is called _*linearity*_.  Linearity represents an important new constraint associated with our circuit elements.  While much of the real world is in fact actually _non-linear_, fortunately, in many cases we can _consider real circuit elements to be linear_ and thereby greatly simplify our analysis and design of circuits.

Lets consider our total physical world and then further confine ourselves to electrical circuits, so this new linearity restriction represents a sub-set of all circuits, "Figure 9.1":#figure9-1.

p=(#figure9-1). !{width:60%}img/9/circuitsF9.1.jpg(Figure 9.1)!:img/9/circuitsF9.1.jpg
_Figure 9.1  Linear Circuits is a Sub-Set, but Crucial Part of All Electrical Circuits_

We will see in this Section exactly how linearity provides such a powerful opportunity for engineers, and especially circuit engineers.  Additionally, with linearity a major new solution method becomes possible, called _*superposition*_.  Complex problems can be greatly simplified with linearity.  And then finally in this Section we examine a new means to represent linear circuits in a highly 'compressed' format, achieved via _Thevenin_ and _Norton_ theorems.  With these theorems, circuits of hundreds, even thousands of elements will be compressed to just two elements.  Thus this Section brings very powerful methods that enable engineers to tackle immensely complex problems.

h4(#chapter9-linearity). 9.1 - Linearity

At this time we will formally introduce an added constraint that is to apply to all the elements we may use in circuits in this course.  This new constraint concerns an added property of circuits.  It is called _linearity_.  Here we mean linear in a 'systems' sense.  As we will see, this is more restrictive than the idea of a linear graph, which refers to any straight-line graph.  In our case for linear circuits we need to apply a more specific constraint, one that ensures there is a highly predictable output (also called a 'response') for an applied input (also sometimes called the 'drive').  We will use a very specific and concise definition for linearity.  Because of the power of the linearity constraint we will see that a circuit comprised of all linear circuit elements will also be linear.

p=. _*(i) Definition*_

Here we will define a 'linear' system as one that satisfies two properties:

** 	(1) the _homogeneity property_,   where:   f(ax)=af(x) for all real a, and

** 	(2) the _additivity property_,        where:   f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)

In words, these two properties mean:

## If we apply double the input, then the response must also double. Notice when input x is zero, then output f(x) must also be zero.
## The response for two simultaneous inputs applied at the same time is the same result as for the two inputs applied separately (with the other input zero) and their individual responses added together.  The additivity property is often referred to as _superposition_ when applied to circuits.

** *9.1.1 Implications and Understandiing*

A linear circuit element is one where the current-voltage relation for that element is restricted to being linear in the above definition.

This linearity is DIFFERENT from simple algebra polynomials, which refer to *any* straight line as 'linear'.  For example, y= mx+b.  However, for the discussion of a linear operation, then a typical straight line *does NOT satisfy our definition of linearity* because a non-zero constant 'b' means when we double x, we do not double y.

All three of *our circuit elements* discussed so far (resistors, fixed voltage, and fixed current sources) *are 'linear' elements*. For example with the resistor:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}R$ = 0

So if the resistor element voltage, $(v_{n1}-v_{n2})$, is doubled then the current $i_R$ must also double, since $R$ is a constant, which does not change with voltage or current.  As an example of a non-linear circuit element, *if* the resistance $R$ *did change with voltage*, then the element would NOT be linear.  For example, suppose we had an element where the 'resistance' increased with current, $R = k i_R$.  Then the constraint equation would become:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}(ki_R)$ = $(v_{n1} - v_{n2})$-$ki_R^2$ = 0

Now if the element voltage $(v_{n1}-v_{n2})$ doubled, the current $i_R$ would NOT double, due to the 'square' term.  This fictitious element is NOT linear.  "Figure 9.2":#figure9-2 shows the i-v characteristic for this type of non-linearity.  Notice the graph is not a straight line, it is non-linear.  In these chapters all elements we use are linear.
 
p=(#figure9-2). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.2.jpg(Figure 9.2)!:img/9/circuitsF9.2.jpg
_Figure 9.2  Example Non-Linear i-v Characteristic_

Both fixed voltage sources and fixed current sources are also linear elements.  This is because when you double the size of a source voltage, $V_S$, the element voltage doubles.  Similarly for a fixed current source, if we double the size of the source current, $I_S$, then, the element current also doubles.

A very important property of linearity is that a circuit comprised entirely of linear elements results in a complete circuit that is also linear.  This is because our conservation laws of KCL and KVL do not violate linearity.  To illustrate, consider the circuit of "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3.  Here we can calculate that the 10 volt voltage source causes a resistor current, $I_B$, of 1/2 milliamp.
 
p=(#figure9-3). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.3.jpg(Figure 9.3)!:img/9/circuitsF9.3.jpg
_Figure 9.3  Example Linear Circuit_

If the voltage source in "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3 is changed to double value, 20 volts, then $I_B$ also is seen to double to 1mA.  And if the voltage source is reduced all the way to zero, the response, $I_B$, would be zero.  This circuit is comprised of linear elements and it yields a linear response with respect to the input sources.  This circuit is a linear system.

h4(#chapter9-superposition). 9.2 - Superposition Method

When we have a linear system, we can apply a solution method called the _superposition method_.  Superposition fails if the system is NOT linear.  So linearity is a _necessary condition_ to be able to apply the superposition method.

For the superposition method, consider we have a network of many linear resistors and multiple linear sources.  Furthermore, we draw this circuit by bringing all the sources to an 'exterior' (visible) part of the circuit.  This is illustrated in "Figure 9.4":#figure9-4.
 
p=(#figure9-4). !{width:60%}img/9/circuitsF9.4.jpg(Figure 9.4)!:img/9/circuitsF9.4.jpg
_Figure 9.4  Circuit of Linear Resistors and Linear Sources._

In this illustration we have a circuit of 8 resistors, 4 voltage sources, and 2 current sources.  Although connected, the actual circuit node connections are not depicted because they are not needed for this discussion.  Also explicitly identified for this illustration are a voltage, $V_{R7}$, across resistor $R_7$; and a current, $I_{R3}$, in resistor $R_3$.

We can write an expression for the voltage across resistor $R_7$ as:

p=. $V_{R7}$ = $a_1 V_{S1} + a_2 V_{S2} + a_3 V_{S3} + a_4 V_{S4} + b_1 I_{S1} + b_2 I_{S2}$

where, all the 'a' and 'b' values are fixed constants for the given circuit.  In other words, the voltage on resistor $R_7$, (and in fact on any resistor in the circuit or for any current in the circuit), is a sum of six terms, each a fixed constant times a source quantity.  These 'a' and 'b' constants are fixed and determined by the circuit connections, resistor values and which voltage or current is being calculated.  These constants _do not depend_ on the value of the source voltages, $V_{Sn}$,  or source currents, $I_{Sn}$.

We could also write a corresponding equation for the current $i_{R3}$.  Indeed as well as for any voltage or any current in our circuit.  Thus, we will always find that any voltage or any current is calculated as a sum of terms with each source contributing some portion to the total sum of terms.

Now we *take the HUGE leap*, one that is permitted explicitly because of the additivity property of linearity. Instead of having all sources ON at the same time, lets make a 'thought' experiment where we turn on ONLY ONE SOURCE AT A TIME, and ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE 'SET-TO-ZERO'.  Hence in the above case, when we have ONLY voltage source $V_{S1}$ ON (the other 5 sources are set-to-zero), so the resistor $R_7$ voltage would be:

p=. $V_{R7-1}$ = $a_1 V_{S1} + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0$  .....  so  .....  $V_{R7-1}$ = $a_1 V_{S1}$

We see, because all other sources are set-to-zero, the only non-zero contribution is from $a_1 V_{S1}$.  Similarly, for ONLY voltage source $V_{S2}$ ON, all other sources set-to-zero:

p=. $V_{R7-2}$ = $a_2 V_{S2}$

and for ONLY voltage sources $V_{S3}$ and $V_{S4}$ ON individually, others set-to-zero:

p=. $V_{R7-3}$ = $a_3 V_{S3}$ _and_ $V_{R7-4}$ =$a_4 V_{S4}$

and for ONLY current sources $I_{S1}$ and $I_{S2}$ ON individually, others set-to-zero:

p=. $V_{R7-5}$ = $b_1 I_{S1}$ _and_ $V_{R7-6}$ = $b_2 I_{S2}$

Notice when we add _all 6 of these individual calculations_ they yield exactly the same answer as if all sources were ON at the same time.  In other words, by activating one source at a time _with all other sources 'set-to-zero'_, then the summation of these individual responses, yields the response of the entire circuit with all sources ON.

We have taken a complex multi-source problem and reduced it to the summation of single-source problems.  This is called the SUPERPOSITION METHOD.

** *9.2.1 Example #1: Solution by Superposition Method*

Consider the circuit of "Figure 9.5":#figure9-5.  It has two voltage sources and 3 resistors and we seek to calculate the output voltage $V_{out}$.
 
p=(#figure9-5). !{width:50%}img/9/circuitsF9.5.jpg(Figure 9.5)!:img/9/circuitsF9.5.jpg
_Figure 9.5  Example Two-Source Circuit_

This is a linear circuit; hence we can apply the method of superposition.  We make two separate circuits: one with 8 volt ON and 12 volt SET-TO-ZERO; and the other with 12 volt ON and 8 volt SET-TO-ZERO, as depicted in "Figure 9.6":#figure9-6.
 
p=(#figure9-6). !{width:95%}img/9/circuitsF9.6.jpg(Figure 9.6)!:img/9/circuitsF9.6.jpg
(1) 8volt Active, 12 volt set-to-zero ........................... (2)  12 volt active, 8 volt set-to-zero
_Figure 9.6  Separate Circuits, One for Each Source Active, other Source 'Set-To-Zero'_

These two sub-problems can be solved by the method of reduction and voltage divider to yield values for the two sub-problem output voltages: $V_{out1}$ and $V_{out2}$.

p=. $V_{out-1}$ = $(\frac{3}{3+3})8$ = 4 volt  ...............  and  ............... $V_{out-2}$ = $(\frac{2}{6+2})12$ = 3 volt

And hence by superposition the total output voltage, $V_{out}$, is the sum of the two sub-problems:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $V_{out-1} + V_{out-2}$ = 4 + 3 = 7 volts

While this is not a complicated problem it does illustrate the process of solution by the superposition method.  An additional benefit of obtaining the output for each source separately is that we also get important understanding about how the circuit works.  For example in this case, we can see that the smaller 8 volt source actually contributes more (4 volts) to the output than contributed by the larger 12 volt source (3 volts).

** *9.2.2 Example #2, Solution by Superposition Method with Current Source*

This next example circuit employs one voltage source and one current source with 2 resistors, "Figure 9.7":#figure9-7.
 
p=(#figure9-7). !{width:55%}img/9/circuitsF9.7.jpg(Figure 9.7)!:img/9/circuitsF9.7.jpg
_Figure 9.7  Example #2 Linear Circuit_

We will again apply the superposition method, BUT BE CAREFUL!  Recall when we turn a source OFF, we 'set-to-zero' the source value.  Hence when OFF, the '*set-to-zero*' requires we set the _value_ of the source to zero.  WE DO NOT REMOVE THE SOURCE.

This means a _*voltage source*_ that is 'set-to-zero' (OFF) makes a _*short-circuit*_, zero volts between it's two terminals.  To see why this is a short-circuit, the voltage source constraint requires the voltage across the source to be fixed at _the value_ of the source (_zero when OFF_), but of course by definition any current can flow through this source, hence it acts as a 'wire' and is a SHORT-CIRCUIT between its' two terminals.

In contrast, a _*current source*_ that is 'set-to-zero' (OFF) makes an *open-circuit*, zero amperes between its' two terminals.  To see why this is an open-circuit, the current source constraint requires the current through the source to be fixed at the value of the source (_zero when OFF_), but by definition of a current source any voltage can be across this source, hence it is an OPEN-CIRCUIT between its’ two terminals.  These two cases are depicted in "Figure 9.8":#figure9-8.
 
p=(#figure9-8). !{width:85%}img/9/circuitsF9.8.jpg(Figure 9.8)!:img/9/circuitsF9.8.jpg
_Figure 9.8  Voltage Source 'Set-To-Zero' and Current Source 'Set-To-Zero'_

With this specific method to 'set-to-zero' our sources, we can now proceed to prepare the two sub-circuits, "Figure 9.9":#figure9-9 for the 2nd example of "Figure 9.7":#figure9-7.
 
p=(#figure9-9). !{width:85%}img/9/circuitsF9.9.jpg(Figure 9.9)!:img/9/circuitsF9.9.jpg
(1) 6 volt Active, 4 mA set-to-zero ........................... (2)  4 mA active, 6 volt set-to-zero
_Figure 9.9  Example #2, Separate Circuits, One for Each Source Active,_
_with the other Source 'Set-To-Zero'_

These two sub-problems can be solved by the method of reduction, voltage divider, and ohm's law to yield values for the two sub-problem output voltages: $V_{out1}$ and $V_{out2}$.

p=. $V_{out-1}$ = ($\frac{4}{4+4})$6 = 3 volts  .....  and  .....  $V_{out-2}$ = ($2k$) 4mA = 8 volts

And hence by superposition the total output voltage, $V_{out}$, is the sum of the two sub-problems:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $V_{out-1}$ + $V_{out-2}$ = 3 + 8 = 11 volts

Notice that the current source has been replaced by an _open-circuit_ when it is 'set-to-zero', and the voltage source has been replaced by a _short-circuit_ when it is 'set-to-zero'.  This is a very important distinction to remember when applying the superposition method to any problem.

Again this example #2 is not a complicated problem, but it does illustrate the _process_ of solution by the superposition method with voltage and current sources.  And again by obtaining the output for each source separately we get important understanding about how the circuit works.  In this case, we can see that the current source contributes much more (8 volts) to the output than contributed by the 6 volt voltage source (3 volts).

It often occurs that in circuit evaluations we need to know not only the final value, but also what contributes by how much to that value.  We see that the superposition method is a valuable tool, not only to make calculations, but also to bring understanding as to how the circuit functions.

h4(#chapter9-thevenin). 9.3 - Thevenin's Theorem

We now develop perhaps the most valuable 'tool' in all electric circuit analysis and design.  It is called _Thevenin's Theorem_, and basically it allows us to replace an entire complex circuit, perhaps with many resistors and many sources, with a very simple circuit with just two elements.  This is the ultimate in 'compression'.  We can even go from thousands of elements to just 2 elements.  This is an enormous reduction in complexity and enables great insight about complex systems.  It is an amazing abstraction.  It seems no other field has this feature.  Certainly for the case of software one cannot typically expect to be able to take 1000s of lines of code and reduce them to just 2 lines, and keep all output information.

The key constraint that enables Thevenin's Theorem to work in circuits is that the CIRCUIT *MUST BE LINEAR*.  So here is another case of where the constraint of linearity allows us to be able to simplify analysis and understand the operation of circuits.  Lets see the concept of Thevenin's Theorem.

We consider a circuit comprised of any combination of resistors and sources, and we 'observe' this circuit from 2-terminals (here shown as A-A') connected to any 2 nodes in the circuit.  This arrangement is depicted in "Figure 9.10":#figure9-10.
 
p=(#figure9-10). !{width:50%}img/9/circuitsF9.10.jpg(Figure 9.10)!:img/9/circuitsF9.10.jpg
_Figure 9.10  Any Circuit with a Single Terminal-Pair, A-A'_

Because this is a linear circuit (_with sources_), we know that it must always have a straight-line i-v relationship, at terminals A-A', as depicted in "Figure 9.11":#figure9-11.
 
p=(#figure9-11). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.11.jpg(Figure 9.11)!:img/9/circuitsF9.11.jpg
_Figure 9.11  Linear Circuit with Sources, i-v Relationship at a Terminal-Pair_
 
Furthermore, because it is a linear circuit, we know that if _all independent_ sources are set-to-zero, then the i-v line MUST go through zero, there cannot be an 'offset'.  There cannot be a non-zero output when the input is zero.  Recall from linearity if the input is zero then the response must be zero too.  Thus, when all inputs are set-to-zero, in "Figure 9.11":#figure9-11 the line must shift and go through the origin, (0,0).  The slope of this line does not change when the voltage is 'set-to-zero', and remains constant with an equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, at the terminals A-A', when all independent source(s) are 'set-to-zero'.

p=. _slope_ = $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}$

Furthermore, the 'intercept' value on the voltage-axis, is where the current is zero, and hence is the 'open-circuit' voltage, $V_{OC}$, for the circuit.

p=. _intercept_ = $V_{OC}$

Here is _*the great insight*_ !  Another circuit _with just two elements_ can produce _*exactly the same line*_ as in "Figure 9.11":#figure9-11, this other circuit, the Thevenin Circuit, is depicted in "Figure 9.12":#figure9-12; and it produces the i-v relation as seen in "Figure 9.13":#figure9-13.

p=(#figure9-12). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.12.jpg(Figure 9.12)!:img/9/circuitsF9.12.jpg
_Figure 9.12  Thevenin Circuit, Two Elements_

p=(#figure9-13). !{width:45%}img/9/circuitsF9.13.jpg(Figure 9.13)!:img/9/circuitsF9.13.jpg
_Figure 9.13  Current-Voltage Relation for Thevenin Circuit_

Notice this i-v line becomes _EXACTLY THE SAME_ as the i-v line in "Figure 9.11":#figure9-11 when Vth and Rth have the following specific values.  To be identical i-v relations, we require:

p=. $V_{th}$ = $V_{OC}$

and

p=. $R_{th}$ = $R_{eq}$ (with independent sources set-to-zero)

Notice for the Thevenin circuit, "Figure 9.12":#figure9-12, when $i$ = 0, there is no voltage across $R_{th}$, and hence $V = V_{th}$, as required.  Thevenin's Theorem simply states what we have just developed, namely: any linear circuit with two terminals can be replaced by the Thevenin equivalent circuit of "Figure 9.12":#figure9-12, where $V_{th}$ = $V_{OC}$ and $R_{th}$ = $R_{eq}$ (with all independent sources 'set to zero').

** 9.3.1 Example Thevenin Equivalent Circuit

Consider the circuit in "Figure 9.14":#figure9-14.

p=(#figure9-14). !{width:55%}img/9/circuitsF9.14.jpg(Figure 9.14)!:img/9/circuitsF9.14.jpg
_Figure 9.14  Circuit with Terminal-Pair A-A'_

The open-circuit condition requires there be NO current at the terminals A-A', and hence there is no current in the 1 ohm resistor.  The open-circuit voltage is thus just the voltage across the 6 ohm resistor.  And this voltage is calculated by the voltage-divider relation.  Hence:

p=. $V_{out-OpenCircuit}$ = $V_{th}$ = $(\frac{6}{6+3})9$ = 6 volt

The Thevenin equivalent resistance $R_{th}$ is found by setting the source-to-zero, hence the equivalent circuit becomes:

p=(#figure9-15). !{width:50%}img/9/circuitsF9.15.jpg(Figure 9.15)!:img/9/circuitsF9.15.jpg
_Figure 9.15  Equivalent Circuit for Calculation of $R_{th}$

Notice the independent voltage source becomes a short-circuit.  By simple reduction the value of $R_{th}$ is:

p=. $R_{th}$ = $(\frac{(6) (3)}{6+3})$ + 1 = 3 ohms

The Thevenin equivalent circuit is thus comprised of $V_{th}$ = 6 volt and $R_{th}$ = 3 ohm, as depicted in "Figure 9.16":#figure9-16.

p=(#figure9-16). !{width:45%}img/9/circuitsF9.16.jpg(Figure 9.16)!:img/9/circuitsF9.16.jpg
_Figure 9.16  Thevenin Equivalent for Circuit of "Figure 9.14":#figure9-14_

h4(#chapter9-norton). 9.4 - Norton's Theorem

An alternate two element circuit that can produce the same linear i-v characteristic of "Figure 9.11":#figure9-11 is comprised of a current source and a resistance.  This circuit is called the _Norton Equivalent_ and is shown in "Figure 9.17":#figure9-17.

p=(#figure9-17). !{width:38%}img/9/circuitsF9.17.jpg(Figure 9.17)!:img/9/circuitsF9.17.jpg
_Figure 9.17  Norton Equivalent Circuit_

The source is now implemented as a current source, IN, and the resistance is the same $R_{th}$ as in the Thevenin equivalent, but here $R_{th}$ is in parallel with the current source.  Notice that when the current source is 'set-to-zero', it is an open-circuit, and hence the equivalent resistance seen from the terminal-pair is $R_{th}$.

When the Norton equivalent is open circuit, all the current from the current source goes through $R_{th}$.  Hence the open-circuit voltage is the product:

p=. $V_{OC}$ = $I_N$ $R_{th}$

The relationship between the i-v characteristics and the Norton and Thevenin equivalent circuit values is depicted in "Figure 9.18":#figure9-18.

p=(#figure9-18). !{width:40%}img/9/circuitsF9.18.jpg(Figure 9.18)!:img/9/circuitsF9.18.jpg
_Figure 9.18  Norton and Thevenin Equivalent Circuit Value Relations_

Also when the output terminals have an applied short-circuit, then all the current, $I_N$, must go through the short.  In other words the Norton current source is the value of current , $-i$, when there is zero volts across the output terminal pair, this is depicted in "Figure 9.19":#figure9-19.

p=(#figure9-19). !{width:45%}img/9/circuitsF9.19.jpg(Figure 9.19)!:img/9/circuitsF9.19.jpg
_Figure 9.19  Short-Circuit Determination of Norton Current Source_

where,

p=. $-i$ = $i_{SC}$ = $I_N$

** 9.4.1 Example Norton Equivalent Circuit

Consider the circuit of "Figure 9.14":#figure9-14, we calculate the Norton equivalent resistance, Rth, the same as for the Thevenin equivalent, hence "Figure 9.15":#figure9-15 is used to arrive at the same value of 3 ohms.  However, the Norton current source value can be found from the relationship to Thevenin, since: 

p=. $I_N$ = $\frac{V_{OC}}{R_{th}}$

and so in this example: $I_N$ = 6v/3ohm = 2Amp. "Figure 9.20":#figure9-20 is the complete Norton equivalent circuit.

p=(#figure9-20). !{width:38%}img/9/circuitsF9.20.jpg(Figure 9.20)!:img/9/circuitsF9.20.jpg
_Figure 9.20  Norton Equivalent of Example Problem_

An alternate way to determine the Norton current source value, $I_N$, is to calculate the short circuit current, and thus in this case by calculating the current in the 1 ohm resistor of "Figure 9.14":#figure9-14 with the terminals shorted, "Figure 9.21":#figure9-21:

p=(#figure9-21). !{width:65%}img/9/circuitsF9.21.jpg(Figure 9.21)!:img/9/circuitsF9.21.jpg
_Figure 9.21  Example Circuit, Terminals Short-Circuited, to Calculate Norton Current $I_N$_

Hence we get

p=. $I_N$ = $i_{SC}$ = $(\frac{9}{3+\frac{6}{7}})$ $\frac{6}{6+1}$ = $\frac{7}{3}$ $\frac{6}{7}$ = 2 amp.

The Norton current value of 2 amps is the same as that calculated by the equivalence above:

p=. $I_N$ = $\frac{V_{OC}}{R_{th}}$.

This demonstrates the consistency of the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits.  Either can be used to fully represent any linear circuit.  The choice of which one to use is only a matter of convenience.
