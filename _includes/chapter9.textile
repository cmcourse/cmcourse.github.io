At this point we introduce a key concept that enables valuable simplifications for circuit analysis and design, it is called _*linearity*_.  Linearity represents an important new constraint associated with our circuit elements.  While much of the real world is in fact actually _non-linear_, fortunately, in many cases we can _consider real circuit elements to be linear_ and thereby greatly simplify our analysis and design of circuits.

Lets consider our total physical world and then further confine ourselves to electrical circuits, so this new linearity restriction represents a sub-set of all circuits, "Figure 9.1":#figure9-1.

We will see in this Section exactly how linearity provides such a powerful opportunity for engineers, and especially circuit engineers.  Additionally, with linearity a major new solution method becomes possible, called _*superposition*_.  Complex problems can be greatly simplified with linearity.  And then finally in this Section we examine a new means to represent linear circuits in a highly 'compressed' format, achieved via _Thevenin_ and _Norton_ theorems.  With these theorems, circuits of hundreds, even thousands of elements will be compressed to just two elements.  Thus this Section brings very powerful methods that enable engineers to tackle immensely complex problems.

At this time we will formally introduce an added constraint that is to apply to all the elements we may use in circuits in this course.  This new constraint concerns an added property of circuits.  It is called _linearity_.  Here we mean linear in a 'systems' sense.  As we will see, this is more restrictive than the idea of a linear graph, which refers to any straight-line graph.  In our case for linear circuits we need to apply a more specific constraint, one that ensures there is a highly predictable output (also called a 'response') for an applied input (also sometimes called the 'drive').  We will use a very specific and concise definition for linearity.  Because of the power of the linearity constraint we will see that a circuit comprised of all linear circuit elements will also be linear.

p=. _(i) Definitions_

Here we will define a 'linear' system as one that satisfies two properties:

** 	(1) the _homogeneity property_,   where:   f(ax)=af(x) for all real a, and

** 	(2) the _additivity property_,        where:   f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)

In words, these two properties mean:

## If we apply double the input, then the response must also double. Notice when input x is zero, then output f(x) must also be zero.
## The response for two simultaneous inputs applied at the same time is the same result as for the two inputs applied separately and their individual responses added together.  The additivity property is often in circuits referred to as superposition.

** 9.1.1 Implications and Understandiing

A linear circuit element is one where the current-voltage relation for that element is restricted to being linear in the above definition.

This linearity is DIFFERENT from simple algebra polynomials, which refer to *any* straight line as 'linear'.  For example, y= mx+b.  However, for the discussion of a linear operation, then a typical straight line *does NOT satisfy our definition of linearity* because a non-zero constant 'b' means when we double x, we do not double y.

All three of *our circuit elements* discussed so far (resistors, fixed voltage, and fixed current sources) *are 'linear' elements*. For example with the resistor:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}R$ = 0

So if the resistor element voltage, ($v_{n1}-v_{n2}), is doubled then the current $i_R$ must also double, since $R$ is a constant, which does not change with voltage or current.  As an example of a non-linear circuit element, if the resistance $R$ *did change with voltage*, then the element would NOT be linear.  For example, suppose we had an element where the 'resistance' increased with current, $R = k iR$.  Then the constraint equation would become:

p=. $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_{R}(kR)$ = $(v_{n1} - v_{n2})$-$ki_R^2$ = 0

Now if the element voltage (vn1-vn2) doubled, the current iR would NOT double, due to the ‘square’ term.  This fictitious element is NOT linear.  "Figure 9.2":#figure9-2 shows the i-v characteristic for this type of non-linearity.  Notice the graph is not a straight line, it is non-linear.  In this course all elements we use are linear.

_Figure 9.2  Example Non-Linear i-v Characteristic_

Both the fixed voltage source and the fixed current sources are also linear.  This is because when you double the size of the source voltage, $V_S$, the element voltage doubles.  Similarly for the fixed current source, if we double the size of the source current, $I_S$, then, the element current also doubles.

A very important property of linearity is that a circuit comprised entirely of linear elements results in a complete circuit that is also linear.  This is because our conservation laws of KCL and KVL do not violate linearity.  To illustrate, consider the circuit of "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3.  Here we can calculate that the 10 volt voltage source causes a resistor current, IB, of ½ milliamp.

_Figure 9.3  Example Linear Circuit_

If the voltage source in "Figure 9.3":#figure9-3 is changed to double value, 20 volts, then $I_B$ also is seen to double to 1mA.  And if the voltage source is reduced all the way to zero, the response, $I_B$, would be zero.  This circuit is comprised of linear elements and it yields a linear response with respect to the input sources.  This circuit is a linear system.
