In prior sections we have developed a consistent method to solve electric circuits.  This solution process employed (1) constraints associated with each individual element in a circuit and additionally (2) conservation laws that yield further constraints associated with the connections of a group of elements, especially Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL).  Although we can always obtain a solution via this process, the more elements in a problem, then the more voltage values that need to be determined.  Thus 'larger' problems with more circuit element require many equations with many variables.

For example, consider the group of 8 resistors and a fixed voltage source depicted in "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1.  To solve this with our 'classical' node method, we will need to write KCL equations at 4 nodes and go through a lengthy math solution.  And of course, the situation would be much worse if there were 20 resistors and over 10 nodes.  While a 'classical' node-method solution does always work, it would be far better to be able to solve such problems as this, almost ‘by inspection’ !  Namely, by a better understanding of circuits we seek to achieve solutions in a greatly simplified manner.

In this section we will apply a couple of circuit topology constraints that will allow us to take initially 'complex' problems, such as in "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1, and reduce them to greatly simplified equivalent configurations.  And then with such simple configurations we can easily solve, often by inspection. These simplifications involve certain restrictions, ones that enable a very rapid evaluation once the configuration is correctly recognized.  It is also true that incorrect assessment of a configuration will result in an incorrect result, so _it is really important to understand the two specific types of topologies_ that we consider in this section.  Lets learn this concept of Equivalence and Circuit Reduction.

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-series). 6.1 - Series Equivalent Resistors: Single-Loop

Recall our special topology the _single loop_ circuit structure, such as from Section 5, "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a.  Here as before our elements are in a _series connection_, and we mean that all elements of the circuit are connected so they form a single loop.  Because the circuit is a single loop, and because of our KCL current law, there can be _only one single current_ that is in all elements in the loop.  "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2 depicts this arrangement for 3 resistors and a fixed voltage source connected in a single loop.

p=(#figure6-2). !{width:30%}img/6/circuitsF6.2.jpg(Figure 6.2)!:img/6/circuitsF6.2.jpg
_Figure 6.2  Single Loop 'Series' Resistor Circuit Configuration_
 
For this circuit, "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2, all 4 elements are connected end-to-end to form a single loop, and there _must be only a single current_, shown as '$i$' in the circuit.  This current, '$i$', passes equally through $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, and fixed source $V_S$.  There is no other side-branch for this current, so the current must be of equal value in all these 4 elements.

Lets focus on the three resistors between node n1 and node n4, these 3 resistors form a _single path_, and they must always have the _same current_.  The value of this current, $i$, is calculated to be:

p=. $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_1}$ = $\frac{(V_{n2}-V_{n3})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3}$ = $\frac{(V_{n3}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

Now add the three resistor element voltages, [(vn1 – vn2) +(vn2 – vn3) +(vn3 – vn4) = (vn1-vn4)], and then by substitution of the element constraints:

p=. $iR_1 + iR_2 + iR_3 = (V_{n1}-V_{n4})$ and hence $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$ = $\frac{V_S}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

Now we can obtain exactly the same value of loop current from another circuit, "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3.  This 'equivalent' circuit has a single resistor of specific value: $R = (R_1+R_2+R_3)$.

p=(#figure6-3). !{width:50%}img/6/circuitsF6.3.jpg(Figure 6.3)!:img/6/circuitsF6.3.jpg
_Figure 6.3  Single Loop, Single Resistor Equivalent_

Notice that this second circuit, "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3, has exactly the same value for current, $i$, of:

p=. $i= \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{R}$ = $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$ = $\frac{V_S}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

As observed at the two nodes, n1 and n4, these two circuits, "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2 and "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3, _yield exactly the same results_.

Thus more generally, we can take any 'single path' (ie. equal current) connection of resistors (we call this a 'series' connection) and replace all those resistors with a single resistor, Requivalent of value equal to the sum of the series connected resistors, "Figure 6.4":#figure6-4,

p=(#figure6-4). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.4.jpg(Figure 6.4)!:img/6/circuitsF6.4.jpg
_Figure 6.4  Equivalent Resistance for 10 Resistors Connected in 'Series'_

Here, *_as seen from the end terminals_* of $v_{n1}$ and $v_{n2}$, these two circuits 6.4(a) and 6.4(b) are exactly the same.  This means we can replace a group of N _series-connected_ resistors with a single 'equivalent' resistor of value, $R_{equiv}$, equal to the sum of those N separate values, "Eq'n. 6.1":#eq6-1.

<h4>
p=(#eq6-1). $R_{equiv}$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{N} R_j$ </h4>

p=. (Resistor Equivalence)  Eq'n 6.1 

For example, if all 10 resistors in "Figure 6.4":#figure6-4 were each 10 ohms, then the equivalent resistor would be a single resistor of 100 ohm value, "Figure 6.5":#figure6-5.

p=(#figure6-5). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.5.jpg(Figure 6.5)!:img/6/circuitsF6.5.jpg
_Figure 6.5  Ten resistor of 10 ohms Each Connected in Series, $R_{equiv}$ = 100 ohms_

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-parallel). 6.2 - Parallel Equivalent Resistors: Single-Node-Pair

Recall our second special topology the _single node-pair_ circuit structure, such as from Section 5, "Figure 5.7a":#figure5-7a.  Here all elements of the circuit are connected so they only connect between 2 nodes.  Because the circuit has a node-pair, and because of our KVL voltage law, there can be only one single voltage across all elements in this circuit.  "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6 depicts this arrangement for 3 resistors and a fixed voltage source.

p=(#figure6-6). !{width:50%}img/6/circuitsF6.6.jpg(Figure 6.6)!:img/6/circuitsF6.6.jpg
_Figure 6.6  Single Node-Pair Resistor Circuit Configuration_

For this circuit, "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6, all 4 elements are connected to a single node-pair, n1 and n2, and there is a single element voltage of '$(v_{n1} – v_{n2})$' in the circuit.  This element voltage is equally across $R_1, R_2, R_3$, and fixed source $V_S$.  There are no other nodes for the voltage, so it must be of equal value in all these 4 elements.  Furthermore, there is a current, $i$, into the ‘group’ of single node-pair connected resistors.  The value of this current, $i$, is calculated by KCL as:

p=. $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_1}$ + $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_2}$ + $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_3}$ = $(V_S)$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

so

p=. $\frac{i}{V_S}$ = $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}$ = $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

Now we can obtain exactly the same value of current from another circuit, "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7.  This has a single resistor. $R_{equiv}$.

p=(#figure6-7). !{width:60%}img/6/circuitsF6.7.jpg(Figure 6.7)!:img/6/circuitsF6.7.jpg
_Figure 6.7  Single Node-Pair, Parallel Single Resistor Equivalent_

Notice that this second circuit, "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7, has exactly the same value for current, $i$, of:

p=. $i = (V_{n1}-V_{n2})$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$ = $(V_S)$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

From the two nodes n1 and n2, these two circuits, "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6 and "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7, yield exactly the same result.

Thus more generally, we can take any 'single node-pair', (ie. _equal voltage_) connection of resistors (_we call this a 'parallel' connection_) and replace those resistors with a single resistor, $R_{equivalent} of inverse value equal to the sum of the inverses of the parallel-connected resistors, "Figure 6.8":#figure6-8,

p=(#figure6-8). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.8.jpg(Figure 6.8)!:img/6/circuitsF6.8.jpg
_Figure 6.8  Equivalent Resistance for 10 Resistors Connected in 'Parallel'_

Thus, *_from the node terminals_* of $v_{n1}$ and $v_{n2}$, and same total current, $i$, these two circuits 6.8(a) and 6.8(b) are exactly the same.  This means we can replace a 'group' of N parallel-connected resistors with a single resistor of value, Requiv, where 1/Requiv is equal to the sum of inverses of those N values, Eq’n 6.2.

p=. $\frac{1}{R_{equiv}}$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{R_j}$

For example, if all 10 resistors in "Figure 6.8":#figure6-8 were each 10 ohms, then the equivalent resistance would be a single resistor of 1 ohm value.

p=(#figure6-9). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.9.jpg(Figure 6.9)!:img/6/circuitsF6.9.jpg
_Figure 6.9  Ten resistor of 10 ohms Each Connected in Parallel, $R_{equiv} = 1 ohms_

Notice in the prior example of ten resistors of 10 ohms each, in series connection yields 100 ohms (a larger value than each individual resistor), while here the _parallel_ connection yielded 1 ohm ( a smaller value than each individual resistor).  This relationship can be expressed more generally, resistors in a single path (‘series’) configuration add so the equivalent resistance is always GREATER than any one single resistor in that group.  And conversely, for resistors between a node-pair ('_parallel_') configuration, which add inversely, so the equivalent is always SMALLER than any one single resistor in the group.

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-series-parallel). 6.3 - Series and Parallel Equivalents, Two Resistors

To apply our circuit configuration constraints of _series_ (single-path) and _parallel_ (single-node-pair) configurations, it is important to understand that these arrangements refer to their _electrical connections and *NOT* the physical positions_ of the resistors.

Thus two resistors in _series_ may look like any of the following arrangements (and even many more), "Figure 6.10":#figure6-10, yet still be in a single path (_equal current_); and thus have a series equivalent resistance value between the two end terminals, A-A', of Eq'n 6.3.  Note some are shown to be 'physically' in side-by-side, yet _electrically_ they are _in-series_, be careful, do not be fooled by the physical looks of circuits, understand the electrical connections.

p=. $R_{equiv}$ = $R_1 + R_2$

p=(#figure6-10). !{width:85%}img/6/circuitsF6.10.jpg(Figure 6.10)!:img/6/circuitsF6.10.jpg
_Figure 6.10  Examples; Series (Single-Path) Connections of Two Resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$
[equal current in all _in-series_ connected resistors]_

Furthermore, two resistors connected in _parallel_ may look like any of the following configurations (and even more), Figure 6.11, yet still be a single node-pair and thus have a _parallel_ equivalent resistance value between the two end terminals, B-B', of Eq'n 6.4

p=.  $\frac{1}{R_{equiv}}$ = $\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2_}$
