In prior sections we have developed a consistent method to solve electric circuits.  This solution process employed (1) constraints associated with each individual element in a circuit and additionally (2) conservation laws that yield further constraints associated with the connections of a group of elements, especially Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL).  Although we can always obtain a solution via this process, the more elements in a problem, then the more voltage values that need to be determined.  Thus 'larger' problems with more circuit element require many equations with many variables.

For example, consider the group of 8 resistors and a fixed voltage source depicted in "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1.  To solve this with our 'classical' node method, we will need to write KCL equations at 4 nodes and go through a lengthy math solution.  And of course, the situation would be much worse if there were 20 resistors and over 10 nodes.  While a 'classical' node-method solution does always work, it would be far better to be able to solve such problems as this, almost ‘by inspection’ !  Namely, by a better understanding of circuits we seek to achieve solutions in a greatly simplified manner.

_Figure 6.1  Multi-Resistor, Multi-Node Problem (8 Resistors, 6 Nodes)_

In this section we will apply a couple of circuit topology constraints that will allow us to take initially 'complex' problems, such as in "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1, and reduce them to greatly simplified equivalent configurations.  And then with such simple configurations we can easily solve, often by inspection. These simplifications involve certain restrictions, ones that enable a very rapid evaluation once the configuration is correctly recognized.  It is also true that incorrect assessment of a configuration will result in an incorrect result, so _it is really important to understand the two specific types of topologies_ that we consider in this section.  Lets learn this concept of Equivalence and Circuit Reduction.

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-series). 6.1 - Series Equivalent Resistors: Single-Loop

Recall our special topology the _single loop_ circuit structure, such as from Section 5, "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a.  Here as before our elements are in a _series connection_, and we mean that all elements of the circuit are connected so they form a single loop.  Because the circuit is a single loop, and because of our KCL current law, there can be _only one single current_ that is in all elements in the loop.  "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2 depicts this arrangement for 3 resistors and a fixed voltage source connected in a single loop.

p=(#figure6-2). !{width:30%}img/6/circuitsF6.2.jpg(Figure 6.2)!:img/6/circuitsF6.2.jpg
_Figure 6.2  Single Loop 'Series' Resistor Circuit Configuration_
 
For this circuit, "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2, all 4 elements are connected end-to-end to form a single loop, and there _must be only a single current_, shown as '$i$' in the circuit.  This current, '$i$', passes equally through $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, and fixed source $V_S$.  There is no other side-branch for this current, so the current must be of equal value in all these 4 elements.

Lets focus on the three resistors between node n1 and node n4, these 3 resistors form a _single path_, and they must always have the _same current_.  The value of this current, $i$, is calculated to be:

p=. $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_1}$ = $\frac{(V_{n2}-V_{n3})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3}$ = $\frac{(V_{n3}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

Now add the three resistor element voltages, [(vn1 – vn2) +(vn2 – vn3) +(vn3 – vn4) = (vn1-vn4)], and then by substitution of the element constraints:

p=. $iR_1 + iR_2 + iR_3 = (V_{n1}-V_{n4})$ and hence $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$ = $\frac{V_S}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

Now we can obtain exactly the same value of loop current from another circuit, "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3.  This 'equivalent' circuit has a single resistor of specific value: $R = (R_1+R_2+R_3)$.

p=(#figure6-3). !{width:50%}img/6/circuitsF6.3.jpg(Figure 6.3)!:img/6/circuitsF6.3.jpg
_Figure 6.3  Single Loop, Single Resistor Equivalent_

Notice that this second circuit, "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3, has exactly the same value for current, $i$, of:

p=. $i= \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{R}$ = $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n4})}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$ = $\frac{V_S}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)}$

As observed at the two nodes, n1 and n4, these two circuits, "Figure 6.2":#figure6-2 and "Figure 6.3":#figure6-3, _yield exactly the same results_.

Thus more generally, we can take any 'single path' (ie. equal current) connection of resistors (we call this a 'series' connection) and replace all those resistors with a single resistor, Requivalent of value equal to the sum of the series connected resistors, "Figure 6.4":#figure6-4,

p=(#figure6-4). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.4.jpg(Figure 6.4)!:img/6/circuitsF6.4.jpg
_Figure 6.4  Equivalent Resistance for 10 Resistors Connected in 'Series'_

Here, *_as seen from the end terminals_* of $v_{n1}$ and $v_{n2}$, these two circuits 6.4(a) and 6.4(b) are exactly the same.  This means we can replace a group of N _series-connected_ resistors with a single 'equivalent' resistor of value, $R_{equiv}$, equal to the sum of those N separate values, "Eq'n. 6.1":#eq6-1.

<h4>
p=(#eq6-1). $R_{equiv}$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{N} R_j$ </h4>

p=. (Resistor Equivalence)  Eq'n 6.1 

For example, if all 10 resistors in "Figure 6.4":#figure6-4 were each 10 ohms, then the equivalent resistor would be a single resistor of 100 ohm value, "Figure 6.5":#figure6-5.

p=(#figure6-5). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.5.jpg(Figure 6.5)!:img/6/circuitsF6.5.jpg
_Figure 6.5  Ten resistor of 10 ohms Each Connected in Series, $R_{equiv}$ = 100 ohms_

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-parallel). 6.2 - Parallel Equivalent Resistors: Single-Node-Pair

Recall our second special topology the _single node-pair_ circuit structure, such as from Section 5, "Figure 5.7a":#figure5-7a.  Here all elements of the circuit are connected so they only connect between 2 nodes.  Because the circuit has a node-pair, and because of our KVL voltage law, there can be only one single voltage across all elements in this circuit.  "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6 depicts this arrangement for 3 resistors and a fixed voltage source.

p=(#figure6-6). !{width:50%}img/6/circuitsF6.6.jpg(Figure 6.6)!:img/6/circuitsF6.6.jpg
_Figure 6.6  Single Node-Pair Resistor Circuit Configuration_

For this circuit, "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6, all 4 elements are connected to a single node-pair, n1 and n2, and there is a single element voltage of '$(v_{n1} – v_{n2})$' in the circuit.  This element voltage is equally across $R_1, R_2, R_3$, and fixed source $V_S$.  There are no other nodes for the voltage, so it must be of equal value in all these 4 elements.  Furthermore, there is a current, $i$, into the ‘group’ of single node-pair connected resistors.  The value of this current, $i$, is calculated by KCL as:

p=. $i = \frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_1}$ + $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_2}$ + $\frac{(V_{n1}-V_{n2})}{R_3}$ = $(V_S)$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

so

p=. $\frac{i}{V_S}$ = $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}$ = $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

Now we can obtain exactly the same value of current from another circuit, "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7.  This has a single resistor. $R_{equiv}$.

p=(#figure6-7). !{width:60%}img/6/circuitsF6.7.jpg(Figure 6.7)!:img/6/circuitsF6.7.jpg
_Figure 6.7  Single Node-Pair, Parallel Single Resistor Equivalent_

Notice that this second circuit, "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7, has exactly the same value for current, $i$, of:

p=. $i = (V_{n1}-V_{n2})$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$ = $(V_S)$ $(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3})$

From the two nodes n1 and n2, these two circuits, "Figure 6.6":#figure6-6 and "Figure 6.7":#figure6-7, yield exactly the same result.

Thus more generally, we can take any 'single node-pair', (ie. _equal voltage_) connection of resistors (_we call this a 'parallel' connection_) and replace those resistors with a single resistor, $R_{equivalent} of inverse value equal to the sum of the inverses of the parallel-connected resistors, "Figure 6.8":#figure6-8,

p=(#figure6-8). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.8.jpg(Figure 6.8)!:img/6/circuitsF6.8.jpg
_Figure 6.8  Equivalent Resistance for 10 Resistors Connected in 'Parallel'_

Thus, *_from the node terminals_* of $v_{n1}$ and $v_{n2}$, and same total current, $i$, these two circuits 6.8(a) and 6.8(b) are exactly the same.  This means we can replace a 'group' of N parallel-connected resistors with a single resistor of value, Requiv, where 1/Requiv is equal to the sum of inverses of those N values, Eq’n 6.2.

p=. $\frac{1}{R_{equiv}}$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{R_j}$

For example, if all 10 resistors in "Figure 6.8":#figure6-8 were each 10 ohms, then the equivalent resistance would be a single resistor of 1 ohm value.

p=(#figure6-9). !{width:95%}img/6/circuitsF6.9.jpg(Figure 6.9)!:img/6/circuitsF6.9.jpg
_Figure 6.9  Ten resistor of 10 ohms Each Connected in Parallel, $R_{equiv} = 1 ohms_

Notice in the prior example of ten resistors of 10 ohms each, in series connection yields 100 ohms (a larger value than each individual resistor), while here the _parallel_ connection yielded 1 ohm ( a smaller value than each individual resistor).  This relationship can be expressed more generally, resistors in a single path (‘series’) configuration add so the equivalent resistance is always GREATER than any one single resistor in that group.  And conversely, for resistors between a node-pair ('_parallel_') configuration, which add inversely, so the equivalent is always SMALLER than any one single resistor in the group.

h4(#chapter6-equivalence-series-parallel). 6.3 - Series and Parallel Equivalents, Two Resistors

To apply our circuit configuration constraints of _series_ (single-path) and _parallel_ (single-node-pair) configurations, it is important to understand that these arrangements refer to their _electrical connections and *NOT* the physical positions_ of the resistors.

Thus two resistors in _series_ may look like any of the following arrangements (and even many more), "Figure 6.10":#figure6-10, yet still be in a single path (_equal current_); and thus have a series equivalent resistance value between the two end terminals, A-A', of Eq'n 6.3.  Note some are shown to be 'physically' in side-by-side, yet _electrically_ they are _in-series_, be careful, do not be fooled by the physical looks of circuits, understand the electrical connections.

p=. $R_{equiv}$ = $R_1 + R_2$

p=(#figure6-10). !{width:85%}img/6/circuitsF6.10.jpg(Figure 6.10)!:img/6/circuitsF6.10.jpg
_Figure 6.10  Examples; Series (Single-Path) Connections of Two Resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$_
_[equal current in all in-series connected resistors]_

Furthermore, two resistors connected in _parallel_ may look like any of the following configurations (and even more),  "Figure 6.11":#figure6-11, yet still be a single node-pair and thus have a _parallel_ equivalent resistance value between the two end terminals, B-B', of Eq'n 6.4

p=.  $\frac{1}{R_{equiv}}$ = $\frac{1}{R_1}$ + $\frac{1}{R_2}$ and so $R_{equiv}$ = $\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$

p=(#figure6-11). !{width:85%}img/6/circuitsF6.11.jpg(Figure 6.11)!:img/6/circuitsF6.11.jpg
_Figure 6.11  Examples; Parallel (Single Node-Pair) Connections of Two Resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$_
_[equal voltage across all in-parallel connected resistors]_

Because the equivalent resistances for _series_ vs _parallel_ arrangements are totally different, it is critical that in every case you accurately identify when the elements are connected as a _single-path (series)_ or as a _single node-pair (parallel)_.  An incorrect assumption results in an incorrect answer.  BE CAREFUL to correctly identify the electrical configuration.

h4(#chapter6-circuit-reductions). 6.4 - Circuit Reduction by Resistor Equivalents

Of course, many circuits are _*NOT ALL* in series, *NOR ALL* in parallel_ !!  They can be a mixture of configurations.  "Figure 6.12":#figure6-12 depicts a 'mixed' configuration of three resistors.

p=(#figure6-12). !{width:30%}img/6/circuitsF6.12.jpg(Figure 6.12)!:img/6/circuitsF6.12.jpg
_Figure 6.12  'Mixed' Configuration of Resistors_

This circuit has more that 1 path, and more than 2 nodes, so the whole 'group' is neither an all-series circuit, nor an all-parallel circuit.  HOWEVER, this circuit can still be reduced to a single equivalent by series and parallel thinking.  !!

The first thing when trying to reduce a circuit is to identify if ANY localized _sub-portion_ of the circuit satisfies either single-path or single-node-pair constraints.  In "Figure 6.12":#figure6-12 we can see that resistors $R_1$ and $R_3$ are both connected to the same two nodes, and thus are _'in-parallel'_; and hence we can reduce them to a single equivalent resistor, Req-a.  This is depicted in "Figure 6.13":#figure6-13.  BE CAREFUL, _resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are NOT in series_ because they are not in a single-path. That is, $R_1$ and $R_2$ *DO NOT have the same current*.  On the other hand, resistors $R_1$ and $R_3$ DO CONNECT TO THE SAME TWO NODES so they are in _parallel_.

p=(#figure6-13). !{width:85%}img/6/circuitsF6.13.jpg(Figure 6.13)!:img/6/circuitsF6.13.jpg
p=. _Figure13(A)  Figure 13(B)   Figure 13(C)_
_Figure 6.13  Sequential Reduction of a Mixed Configuration_

So we can calculate the value of $R_{eq-a}$  (as $R_1$ and $R_3$ in parallel) from eq'n 6.4 as:

p=. $R_{eq-a}$ = $\frac{R_1 R_3}{R_1 + R_3}$

After the reduction of $R_1$ and $R_3$ to $R_{eq-a}$, the circuit now has two resistors, $R_{eq-a}$ and $R_2$, Figure 6.13(B).  But now both of these are in a single-path configuration (_series_), Figure 6.13(B).  So the final equivalent resistance $R_{eq-b}$ between terminals C-C', 6.13(C) is:

p=. $R_{eq-b}$ = $R_2 + R_{eq-a}$ = $R_2$ + $\frac{R_1 R_3}{R_1 + R_3}$

So a _sequential reduction_ using the _series_ and _parallel equivalents_ applied separately to *parts* of the circuit (when correctly applied) enables us to reduce a complex circuit down to a single resistor.

h4(#chapter6-voltage-divider). 6.5 - Resistor Equivalents and Voltage-Dividers

Lets look at another example where we can use our reduction methods concept, but this time we will additionally use our 'voltage-divider' concept as well.  Furthermore we seek to obtain a solution for specific circuit voltages via these techniques.

Consider a circuit configured as in Figure "Figure 6.14":#figure6-14.  Here this is also a 'mixed' circuit that is neither all-series, nor all-parallel, this is like the circuit of Figure "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1.  Of course, we could solve this by writing the 4 node-voltage equations for each of the 4 nodes, but this is a lengthy process.  Instead, now we will solve it by reduction and find a numerical solution value for the voltage at the output terminals: $V_{out}$.

p=(#figure6-14). !{width:60%}img/6/circuitsF6.14.jpg(Figure 6.14)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14.jpg
_Figure 6.14  Mixed Circuit Problem_

Here we are not just asking for only an equivalent resistance, rather we want a numerical value for a specific voltage.  In this case we want the voltage across the 'final' right-most 2 ohm resistor.  We break the solution process into a sequence of several simple tasks, our first task is to determine what is needed in order to obtain the output voltage, $v_{out}$.

# *Task A:*  Notice the output voltage, $V_{out}$, can be calculated via a voltage divider if $V_a$ is known
** And by a similar process $V_a$  can be calcuated via another voltage divider if $V_b$ is known
# *Task B:*  Find the voltage $V_b$ value by use of several resistance reductions and a voltage divider
** First reduce the resistances to obtain a single equivalent resistance at $V_b$.
# *Task C:*  Use the voltage $V_b$ to calculate $V_a$, and then the desired $V_{out}$

*Task A:* We recognize the 4 and 2 ohm resistors near the output, right-most, are connected in series, AND THUS we see that they cause a voltage divider relationship for voltage $V_{out}$, from voltage $V_a$, "Figure 6.14a":#figure6-14a.

p=(#figure6-14a). !{width:38%}img/6/circuitsF6.14a.jpg(Figure 6.14a)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14a.jpg
_Figure 6.14a  Sub-Part: Voltage Divider of Full Mixed Circuit Problem_

We use the voltage-divider relation to determine voltage $V_{out}$ when we know the voltage $V_a$, because the output, $v_{out}$, is just 1/3rd of $V_a$, as calculated by:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $\frac{2}{2+4} V_a$ = $\frac{1}{3} V_a$

*TASK B:* But as of yet, we do not have a value for $V_a$.  So lets get it.  If we know the value of the node voltage $V_b$, then we can obtain the voltage $V_a$, lets see how.

We can reduce the circuit to the right of node $V_a$, since the 4 and 2 ohm resistors are in series and result in Req1 = 6 ohms, so the resultant circuit becomes:

p=. !{width:60%}img/6/circuitsF6.14b.jpg(Figure 6.14b)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14b.jpg

but now notice the two 6 ohm resistors are both connected at node Va and so are in parallel, and that means they can also be reduced to an equivalent $R_{eq2}$ = 3 ohms:

p=. $R_{eq2}$ = $\frac{6 6}{6+6}$ = 3 ohm

So now the further reduced circuit becomes:

p=(#figure6-14c). !{width:45%}img/6/circuitsF6.14c.jpg(Figure 6.14c)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14c.jpg
_Figure 6.14b  Voltage Divider, Portion of Full Mixed Circuit Problem_

Here there is again a voltage divider relation between $V_a$ and $V_b$, $V_a = ½ V_b$.
 
p=. $V_a$ = $(\frac{3}{3+3})V_{b}$ = $\frac{1}{2}V_b$

And now we need to obtain voltage $V_b$, but by further reduction, the two right-side 3 ohm resistors are _in series_, so we get the still further reduced circuit with $R_{eq3} = 6$:

p=. !{width:50%}img/6/circuitsF6.14d.jpg(Figure 6.14d)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14d.jpg

And again by reduction the two parallel 6 ohm resistors on the right side become, $R_{eq4} = 3$ ohm; so the 'fully reduced' circuit of the original 6-resistor circuit is reduced to just 2-resistors. "Figure 6.15":#figure6-15.

p=(#figure6-15). !{width:40%}img/6/circuitsF6.14e.jpg(Figure 6.15)!:img/6/circuitsF6.14e.jpg
_Figure 6.15  Fully Reduced Circuit to Calculate Node Voltage, $V_b$_

*TASK C:* Solving for Vout. Since "Figure 6.15":#figure6-15 is a voltage-divider circuit we can write by inspection:

p=. $V_b$ = $(\frac{3}{3+3})(12)$ = 6 volts

Now with the value for $V_b$ we look at the preceding reduced circuit, "Figure 6.14b":#figure6-14b, that relates $V_b$. to $V_a$.  As solved above, this too is a voltage-divider relation, so:

p=. $V_a$ = $(\frac{3}{3+3})(12) V_b$ = $(\frac{1}{2})$ 6 = 3 volts

and finally from the reduced circuit with $V_a$,"Figure 6.14a":#figure6-14a, by voltage-divider again we use the calculated the node voltage $V_a$, and hence the output voltage, $V_{out}$, is 1 volt, by:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $(\frac{2}{2+4})V_a$ = $(\frac{2}{2+4})(\frac{3}{3+3}) V_b$ = $(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{1}{2}) 6$ = 1 volt

The overall process of sequential reduction is thus a _sequence of small calculations_, often easily done by hand.  And when collected together these small calculations are combined to determine the result for a complex problem, like that in "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1 or "Figure 6.14":#figure6-14.

While it does take practice to quickly and accurately recognize _series, parallel_ and _voltage-divider_ configurations, once mastered, circuit calculation by reduction goes more quickly and with better understanding than extended node equation analysis.  In the above example, from the reduced circuits we can see that the "Figure 6.1":#figure6-1 circuit is a series of voltage-dividers that can be calculated when the localized _equivalent resistances_ are determined.

In the next Chapter 7 we continue to apply these concepts and consider power in resistive circuits, and especially how to design a circuit for equal power dissipation over an array of connected resistors.
