Recall that power transfer is one of the major goals for electric circuits.  The electric-grid that supplies power to homes and industry is arranged for efficient power delivery from the source to the load.  But is this case the load is whatever a customer connects, so the source is designed to supply power to _all loads_ with minimal loss during delivery.  Power is also an important concern for communications circuits.  For example, when data is transmitted from a satellite to earth, due to the very limited power at the satellite it is extremely important to couple as much available signal power to the antenna for data transmission back to earth.  Furthermore, we may seek to minimize wasted power in portable electronics to achieve longer battery life.  Thus power is not only an issue for heating, motors, etc., but significant for data and information systems as well.

In this chapter we examine power in circuits, and use two specific problems to illustrate ways to understand the impact of power constraints on circuits.  Firstly, we will look at ways to distribute power uniformly over a desired set of resistor elements. This might occur when trying to make a uniformly heated surface.  For efficient communications it is often important to maximize the amount of signal captured from a source of limited power. Thus for our second example we seek to maximize the power transferred from a given source into a resistive load.

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.1 - Uniform Power Over Multiple Resistors

Here we seek to design a resistive circuit that dissipates a uniform amount of _heat per resistor_.  And furthermore we would like to do this on an array of multiple resistors.  Recall that the heat dissipation produced by a single resistor is the product of the voltage across the resistor times the current through the resistor (with our polarity convention).

p=. $p_{resistor} = (v_r) (i_r)$

Thus to achieve uniform heating over several resistors it is necessary to make _this product the same_ for each individual resistor in the heating network.  The individual currents and voltages may be different, _but for equal heating it is only their product that must be constant_.

One example is a spatially extended 'grid' of resistors, "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1, in a manner similar to that used to cause a large area of uniform defrost heating on the rear window of a car.

p=(#figure7-1). !{width:60%}img/7/circuitsF7.1.jpg(Figure 7.1)!:img/7/circuitsF7.1.jpg

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.2 - Example: Two Resistor Uniform Heating

** _(i) Parallel Connected Resistors_

To better understand the uniform heating constraint, lets first consider a parallel two-resistor network connected to a constant voltage source as depicted in "Figure 7.2":#figure7-2.

p=(#figure7-2). !{width:40%}img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg(Figure 7.2)!:img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg
_Figure 7.2  Two Resistor Heater, Parallel Connected_

The goal is to select the value of resistor $R_2$ in relation to resistor $R_1$, so that both resistors dissipate the _same power_.  To do this we need to equate the power dissipated in each resistor, equation [7.1].

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1)(i_1) = p_2 = (v_2)(i_2)$

where, $i_1$ and $i_2$ are the currents in resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively, and $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the voltages _across_ $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively.  But here the two resistors are connected in *parallel*, to same node-pair, an equal voltage connection.  Hence $v_1 = v_2$.  Also they are in parallel with the voltage source $V_S$, so by substitution: $v_1 = v_2$ = $V_S$, and thus, equation [2].

p=. $(V_S i_1) = (V_S i_2)$

Hence to get equal power dissipated by these 2 _parallel_ resistors we need $i_1 = i_2$.  Now for each resistor we can apply ohm's law, this leads to the answer: when $R_1 = R_2$ there is equal power dissipated in both resistors.

** _(ii) Series Connected Resistors_

Alternately the two resistors could be connected in series, a single path (equal current), see "Figure 7.3":#figure7-3.

p=(#figure7-3). !{width:37%}img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg(Figure 7.3)!:img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg
_Figure 7.3  Two Resistor Heater, Series Connected_

Again for equal power the product of voltage-across and current-in each resistor must be the same, hence:

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1 i_1) = p_2 = (v_2 i_2)$

but, since a series circuit; $i_1 = i_2 = i$ :

p=. $(v_1 i) = (v_2 i)$

So for equal power in both resistors must have the same voltage, $v_1 = v_2 = v$, and since they have the same current, $i$, hence

p=. $R_1 = (\frac{v}{i}) = R_2$

We conclude to get equal power dissipation for two _series_ connected resistors their values need to be equal, $R_1 = R_2$ .

h4(#chapter7-four-resistor). 7.3 - Example: Four Resistor Equal Heating

A more complex equal power example occurs with the symmetric 4-resistor network connected to a constant voltage source, depicted in "Figure 7.4":#figure7-4.  The goal here is that all 4 individual resistors produce the same heating power.  In other words the design constraint in this problem is to have the product (v)  (i) be the same in _each_ of the four resistors.

p=(#figure7-4). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.4.jpg(Figure 7.4)!:img/7/circuitsF7.4.jpg
_Figure 7.4  Example Four-Resistor Equal Power Heater_

Notice, that in this Figure there are only two resistor values $R_1$ and $R_2$.  The reason is that we already found that two parallel-connected resistors must be of the same value to exhibit equal heating.  And also we know two series-connected resistors must be equal for equal heating.  Thus, the two $R_1$ resistors are in parallel and must be equal.  And similarly, the two $R_2$ resistors are in series and must be equal.

Our task is to find the relationship between $R_1$ and $R_2$ that makes both pairs dissipate the same power.  This equal power constraint is thus:

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1 i_1) = p_2 = (v_2 i_2)$

For this circuit the voltages and currents are depicted in "Figure 7.5":#figure7-5.  Note the two $R_2$ resistors are in series so they both have the same current $i_2$, and the two $R_1$ resistors are in parallel and have the same current $i_1$ because they have the same resistance value.

p=(#figure7-5). !{width:47%}img/7/circuitsF7.5a.jpg(Figure 7.5)!:img/7/circuitsF7.5a.jpg
_Figure 7.5  Circuit Details for Uniform Heating_

By KCL, these currents must be related:

p=. $-i_2 + i_1 + i_1 = 0$  so  $i_2 = i_1 + i_1$ = $2i_1$

Now we can express the power dissipated in resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively, as for $R_1$:

p=. $p_1 = v_1i_1$  =  $(i_1R_1)i_1$  =  $R_1 (i_1)^2$
and for $R_2$:

p=. $p_2 = v_2i_2$  =  $(i_2R_2)i_2$  =  $R_2 (i_2)^2$

Equating power values:

p=. $R_1(i_1)^2 = R_2(i_2)^2$

And by substitution of the KCL constraint Eqn: $i_2 = 2 i_1$:

p=. $R_1(i_1)^2 = R_2(i_2)^2$  =  $R_2(2i_1)^2$

so the result is:

p=. $R_1 = 4 R_2$

To determine the value for the power dissipated in terms of the voltage source $V_S$, we use the equivalent circuit of "Figure 7.6":#figure7-6, with resistor values given in terms of $R_1$.

p=(#figure7-6). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.6b.jpg(Figure 7.6)!:img/7/circuitsF7.6b.jpg
_Figure 7.6  Equivalent Circuit with Equal Power Constraint on *4 Resistors*_
 
The total equivalent resistance of these three series connected resistors is just $R_1$.  So the total power dissipated by *all four resistors* is therefore:

p=. $p_{total}$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_1}$

And so for each of the four original resistors the power dissipated is 1/4 of this, or:

p=. $p_{resistor}$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2}{4R_1}$

Finally, to design specific values for the resistances to be used we need to select the desired power level and supply voltage.  If we use 1/4 watt resistors, and if we are able to notice heating by touch at about 1/2 that rated power; then we should design for 1/8 watt dissipation _in each resistor_.

Hence for a supply voltage of Vs = 10 volts, and 1/8 watt power dissipation per resistor, the designed value of $R_1$ becomes:

p=. $R_1$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2}{4(1/8)}$  =  $2 x 10^2$  =  200 ohms

and thus using eq'n [9] we also design the $R_2$ value as:

p=. $R_2$ = $(\frac{1}{4})8(\frac{(V_S)^2}{4})$  =  50 ohms.

h4(#chapter7-2nd-four-resistor). 7.4 - 2nd Example: Four Resistor Equal Heating

A slightly different resistor configuration for the goal of uniform heating is depicted in "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7.

p=(#figure7-7). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.7.jpg(Figure 7.7)!:img/7/circuitsF7.7.jpg
_Figure 7.7  Equal Power Circuit Configuration II_

Note this circuit is a simplified view of a larger 'grid' of resistors that might be used to cause a large area of uniform heating, as shown in "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1. To solve the equal power condition for "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1 just requires more math compared to the solution for "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7.

The calculation process for Configuration II, "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7 proceeds by recognition that there are three resistors in series, the $R_1$ and $R_2$ resistors.  Hence from Section 7.2 above, for equal power these three resistors must all have the same value, namely $R_2 = R_1$.

The three series resistors exhibit an equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, of $3(R_1)$. And that equivalent resistance is in parallel with $R_3$.  Thus for all four resistors to dissipate equal power we need $R_3$ to dissipate 1/3 of the power dissipated by $R_{eq}$.  But the power dissipated in $R_3$ is just:

p=. $P_{R3}$  =  $V_S i_{R3}$  =  $V_S(\frac{V_S}{R_3})$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_3}$

and we need to set the power dissipated by $R_{eq}$, to be $3P_{R3}$, so:

p=. $\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_{eq}}$  =  $3 P_{R3}$  =  $3(\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_3})$

However, from above $R_{eq} = 3R_1$, so by substitution:

p=. $\frac{(V_S)^2}{3R_1}$  =  $3\frac{(V_s)^2}{R_3}$

So finally for equal power dissipation in all four resistors in Figure 7-7, we require:

p=. $R_2 = R_1$  and  $R_3 = 9 R_1$

More elaborate arrangements such as "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1 require repeated application of these basic constraint concepts.

h4(#chapter7-max-power-xfer). 7.5 - Maximum Power Transfer

Consider the case where we are given a particular power source.  If we could 'design' a resistive load, what would it be in order to extract the maximum power possible from the *given* source.  Recall power is the _product_ of the voltage across an element times the current through that element, with polarity conventions to set the positive product as power dissipated.

Now lets consider a fixed voltage source depicted in "Figure 7.8":#figure7-8.  Here we use an _ideal_ voltage source, which by definition keeps the load voltage at fixed value _independent of the amount of current from the source_.

p=(#figure7-8). !{width:38%}img/7/circuitsF7.8.jpg(Figure 7.8)!:img/7/circuitsF7.8.jpg
_Figure 7.8  Ideal Fixed Voltage Source Connected to a Load_

By polarity convention, the power dissipated in the load is ($V_{load}$)  ($i_S$).  And the power dissipated by the source is ($V_S$) $(-i_S)$.  Of course the sum of all power dissipated by the circuit is zero, in agreement with these two values for source and load.

However, in the _real world_ one cannot draw an infinite amount of current from a source, because that would mean infinite power. More typically for real sources the source 'output' voltage decreases as the current drawn from the source increases.  This real-world limit of _*finite source current*_ can be represented in our circuits by a finite value of internal source resistance, $R_S$, which is an inherent internal part of any real source. "Figure 7.9":#figure7-9 depicts this 'real-world' source with finite source resistance, $R_S$.

p=(#figure7-9). !{width:50%}img/7/circuitsF7.9.jpg(Figure 7.9)!:img/7/circuitsF7.9.jpg
_Figure 7.9  Practical Model with Source Resistance, $R_S$, and Load Resistance, $R_L$_

Here the load is specifically represented as an equivalent resistance, $R_L$.  The source current $i_S$ equals the load current, $i_L$, because there is a single loop circuit.

Notice with the finite source resistance, $R_S$, when the load current increases ($R_L$ smaller), then the voltage at the load, $V_L$, decreases due to the voltage drop across $R_S$.  This reduction in load voltage, $V_L$, is expressed by Eq'n. 11, where by ohm's law and KVL:

p=. $V_L = V_S - i_L R_S$

Here we can see when $i_L$ increases. $V_L$ must decrease.  So $V_L$ even becomes zero when $i_L$ is $V_S$ / $i_S$.  But power into the load is the $(V_L$)  $(i_L)$ product, and thus becomes zero at this current.

So the power delivered to the load is *zero* when either $V_L$ is zero or $i_L$ is zero.  Said in another way, the power to the load becomes very small when either $V_L$ is very small or $i_L$ is very small.  These two extremes occur when the load resistance $R_L$ is either very small ($V_L$ small), or very large ($i_L$ small), respectively.  Thus, we see that the load resistance cannot be too small nor too large, but rather, there is an _optimum_ resistance of the load, $R_{L-opt}$, where there is *maximum power transfer from the fixed source to load*.  Now assume we have a practical source with fixed voltage value, $V_S$, and with fixed equivalent source resistance, $R_S$.  Our task is to find the optimum value of the load resistance that _*maximizes*_ the power dissipated in the load resistance with this fixed real source.

This can be represented graphically by the power curve in "Figure 7.10":#figure7-10, a small $R_L$ yields small power to the load and a large $R_L$ also yields small power to the load.

p=(#figure7-10). !{width:80%}img/7/circuitsF7.10.jpg(Figure 7.10)!:img/7/circuitsF7.10.jpg
_Figure 7.10  Estimated Power Transfer to Load, Maximum at $R_{L-opt}$_

Lets calculate the current in this single-loop circuit.  By equivalent total resistance of $R_S+R_L$, we can write:

p=. $i_L$  =  $\frac{V_S}{(R_S + R_L)}$

where the load voltage is:

p=. $V_L$ = $i_L R_L$

Thus, the power dissipated by the load is:

p=. $P_{L-dissipated}$ = $(V_L) (i_L)$ = $(i_L R_L) (i_L)$ = $(i_L)^2 R_L$

By substitution and in terms of fixed source value constants: $V_S$, and $R_S$; the power dissipated in the load is, Eq'n 12:

p=. $P_{L-dissipated}$ = $(\frac{V_S}{R_S + R_L})^2$ $R_L$ = $[\frac{R_L}{(R_S + R_L)^2}]$ $(V_S)^2$

To get the maximum power point, notice that the peak occurs at the point where the slope of the power curve is zero, "Figure 7.10":#figure7-10.  But the derivative of the curve is the slope, thus to find the peak power to the load we calculate the derivative of power dissipated in load $P_L$ with respect to $R_L$ and set it to zero, Eq'n 13.

<h4>
p=. $\frac{dP_L}{dR_L}$ = $[\frac{(R_S + R_L)^2 - R_L (2)(R_S + R_L)(1)]}{(R_S + R_L)^4}]$ $(V_S)^2$ = 0</h4>

The solution to this equation gives the value for $R_L$ that is $R_{L-opt}$ for max power transfer to the load. Note, $V_S$ and $R_S$ are constants and hence are fixed in regard to taking the derivative, solving:

p=. $(R_S + R_{L-opt})^2$ - $2 (R_{L-opt}) (R_S + R_{L-opt})$ = 0

so

p=. $(R_S + R_{L-opt}) - 2R_{L-opt}$ = 0

and thus:

p=. $R_{L-opt}$ = $R_S$

_The maximum power transfer occurs under this *'Matched Condition'* when the value of the load resistance, $R_L$, is equal to the fixed source resistance, $R_S$._

This is an exceedingly important result and applies to signal communications for satellites, TV, audio systems, and ethernet cables.  The maximum signal acquired by a 'load' occurs with the _matched resistance_ condition.

There are a number of practical examples of these 'matched-load' systems.  The Table 7-1 below lists the application and the corresponding industry accepted 'standard' source resistance values.

**  7.5.1  _Measurement of Unknown Source Resistance, $R_S$_

At times for some equipment the equivalent source resistance may not be known.  The source may be a complex instrument so that an ohm-meter cannot be applied, since it would inject a voltage into the source output and perhaps damage the source.  Many sources are designed to ONLY have a load resistance connected at the output. Thus a non-destructive means is needed to measure $R_S$.

One simple way to measure RS, is to make two different voltage measurements at the output of the source, Test-1 and Test-2.  First we measure the output with NO-LOAD connected.  This Test-1 yields the value for the internal source voltage VS.  Since there is no load, there is no current in RS and the voltage measured at the source terminals is the internal voltage VS, "Figure 7.11":#figure7-11 (a).

p=(#figure7-11). !{width:90%}img/7/circuitsF7.11.jpg(Figure 7.11)!:img/7/circuitsF7.11.jpg
$(a)$ Test-1   .......................................   $(b)$ Test-2
_Figure 7.11  Two Tests to Measure Unknown Source Resistance, $R_S$_

Secondly, Test-2, we make another voltage measurement at the source output, but this time with a known load resistance, $R_L$, connected at the output, "Figure 7.11":#figure7-11 (b).  With the load resistor connected, the voltage at the output must be lower than the no-load value, $V_S$.  By voltage divider relation the load-connected output voltage is:

p=. $V_{out-L}$ = $(\frac{R_L}{R_S + R_L})$ $V_S$

But from Test-1 ($R_L$ >> $R_S$) :

p=. $V_{out-open}$ = $V_S$

By substitution and solving for $R_S$, we get:

p=. $R_S$ = $R_L$ ($\frac{V_{out-open}}{V_{out-Load}}$)

Notice that if the load resistor, $R_L$ , value during this Test-2 measurement is adjusted so that the output voltage is exactly 1/2 the open-circuit value, then that specific $R_L$ is equal to $R_S$.  Hence, the two voltage tests, where $V_{out-L}$ is set equal to 1/2 $V_{out-open}$, enables measurement of $R_S$, by knowing the $R_L$ value required to obtain 1/2 output,  Eq'n. 15.

p=. $R_S$ = $R_L$ when $V_{out-Load}$ = ($\frac{1}{2}$) ($V_{out-open})$

For example, with common lab instrumentation, the output resistance of a signal generator is often specified to be 50 ohms.  This can be confirmed with the simple 2-step tests as above with RL set at 50 ohms.  If the voltage ratio, $v_{Load}$ / $v_{Open}$ is 1/2 then $R_S$ is 50 ohms, but if the voltage ratio is > 1/2, $R_S$ is less than 50 ohms; or if < 1/2, $R_S$ is > 50 ohms.

A simple calculation for the ratio of test voltages, ($v_{Load}$ / $v_{Open}$), is obtained from the prior calculation where:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{R_S}{R_L}$ = ($\frac{V_{out-open}}{V_{out-Load}}$-1) = $\frac{1-A}{A}$</h4>
where $A$ = $\frac{Test-2}{Test-1}$

More generally we can make the normalized plot for the ratio: $R_S$ / $R_L$, versus the ratio of the 2 tests voltages, $v_{Load}/v_{Open}$ as depicted in "Figure 7.12":#figure7-12.  Here the region where $R_S$ is within about a factor of 2 from the connected load resistance, $R_L$, is shown.
