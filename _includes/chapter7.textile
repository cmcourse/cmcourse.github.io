Recall that power transfer is one of the major goals for electric circuits.  The electric-grid that supplies power to homes and industry is arranged for efficient power delivery from the source to the load.  But is this case the load is whatever a customer connects, so the source is designed to supply power to _all loads_ with minimal loss during delivery.  Power is also an important concern for communications circuits.  For example, when data is transmitted from a satellite to earth, due to the very limited power at the satellite it is extremely important to couple as much available signal power to the antenna for data transmission back to earth.  Furthermore, we may seek to minimize wasted power in portable electronics to achieve longer battery life.  Thus power is not only an issue for heating, motors, etc., but significant for data and information systems as well.

In this chapter we examine power in circuits, and use two specific problems to illustrate ways to understand the impact of power constraints on circuits.  Firstly, we will look at ways to distribute power uniformly over a desired set of resistor elements. This might occur when trying to make a uniformly heated surface.  For efficient communications it is often important to maximize the amount of signal captured from a source of limited power. Thus for our second example we seek to maximize the power transferred from a given source into a resistive load.

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.1 - Uniform Power Over Multiple Resistors

Here we seek to design a resistive circuit that dissipates a uniform amount of _heat per resistor_.  And furthermore we would like to do this on an array of multiple resistors.  Recall that the heat dissipation produced by a single resistor is the product of the voltage across the resistor times the current through the resistor (with our polarity convention).

p=. $p_{resistor} = (v_r) (i_r)$

Thus to achieve uniform heating over several resistors it is necessary to make _this product the same_ for each individual resistor in the heating network.  The individual currents and voltages may be different, _but for equal heating it is only their product that must be constant_.

One example is a spatially extended 'grid' of resistors, "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1, in a manner similar to that used to cause a large area of uniform defrost heating on the rear window of a car.

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.2 - Example: Two Resistor Uniform Heating

To better understand the uniform heating constraint, lets first consider a parallel two-resistor network connected to a constant voltage source as depicted in "Figure 7.2":#figure7-2.

p=(#figure7-2). !{width:40%}img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg(Figure 7.2)!:img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg
_Figure 7.2  Two Resistor Heater, Parallel Connected_

The goal is to select the value of resistor $R_2$ in relation to resistor $R_1$, so that both resistors dissipate the _same power_.  To do this we need to equate the power dissipated in each resistor, equation [7.1].

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1)(i_1) = p_2 = (v_2)(i_2)$

where, $i_1$ and $i_2$ are the currents in resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively, and $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the voltages _across_ $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively.  But here the two resistors are connected in *parallel*, to same node-pair, an equal voltage connection.  Hence $v_1 = v_2$.  Also they are in parallel with the voltage source $V_S$, so by substitution: $v_1 = v_2$ = $V_S$, and thus, equation [2].

p=. $(V_S i_1) = (V_S i_2)$

Hence to get equal power dissipated by these 2 _parallel_ resistors we need $i_1 = i_2$.  Now for each resistor we can apply ohm's law, this leads to the obvious answer: when  , there is equal power dissipated in both resistors.

Alternately the two resistors could be connected in series, a single path (equal current), see "Figure 7.3":#figure7-3.

p=(#figure7-3). !{width:37%}img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg(Figure 7.3)!:img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg
_Figure 7.3  Two Resistor Heater, Series Connected_

Again for equal power the product of voltage-across and current-in each resistor must be the same, hence:

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1 i_1) = p_2 = (v_2 i_2)$

but, since a series circuit; $i_1 = i_2 = i$ :

p=. $(v_1 i) = (v_2 i)$

So both resistors must have the same voltage, $v$, but they have the same current, so

p=. $R_1 = (\frac{v}{i}) = R_2$

Again to get equal power dissipation the two _series_ resistor values need to be equal, $R_1 = R_2$ .

h4(#chapter7-four-resistor). 7.3 - Example: Four Resistor Equal Heating

A more complex equal power example occurs with the symmetric 4-resistor network connected to a constant voltage source, depicted in "Figure 7.4":#figure7-4.  The goal here is that all 4 individual resistors produce the same heating power.  In other words the design constraint in this problem is to have the product (v)  (i) be the same in _each_ of the four resistors.

p=(#figure7-4). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.4.jpg(Figure 7.4)!:img/7/circuitsF7.4.jpg
_Figure 7.4  Example Four-Resistor Equal Power Heater_

Notice, that in this Figure there are only two resistor values $R_1$ and $R_2$.  The reason is that we already found that two parallel-connected resistors must be of the same value to exhibit equal heating.  And also we know two series-connected resistors must be equal for equal heating.  Thus, the two $R_1$ resistors are in parallel and must be equal.  And similarly, the two $R_2$ resistors are in series and must be equal.

Our task is to find the relationship between $R_1$ and $R_2$ that makes both pairs dissipate the same power.  This equal power constraint is thus:

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1 i_1) = p_2 = (v_2 i_2)$

In the circuit these voltages and currents are depicted in "Figure 7.5":#figure7-5.

p=(#figure7-5). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.5.jpg(Figure 7.5)!:img/7/circuitsF7.5.jpg
_Figure 7.5  Circuit Details for Uniform Heating_

By KCL, these currents must be related:

p=. $-i_2 + i_1 + i_1 = 0$  so  $i_2 = i_1 + i_1$ = $2i_1$

Now we can express the power dissipated in resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively, as:

p=. $p_1 = v_1i_1$  =  $i_1R_1i_1$  =  $R_1 (i_1)^2$

and

p=. $p_2 = v_2i_2$  =  $i_2R_2i_2$  =  $R_2 (i_2)^2$

Equating:

p=. $R_1(i_1)^2 = R_2(i_2)^2$

And by substitution of the KCL constraint Eqn [4]:

p=. $R_1(i_1)^2 = R_2(i_2)^2$  =  $R_2(2i_1)^2$

so the result is:

p=. $R_1 = 4 R_2$

To determine the value for the power dissipated in terms of the voltage source $V_S$, we use the equivalent circuit of "Figure 7.6":#figure7-6, with resistor values given in terms of $R_1$.

p=(#figure7-6). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.6b.jpg(Figure 7.6)!:img/7/circuitsF7.6b.jpg
_Figure 7.6  Equivalent Circuit with Equal Power Constraint on *4 Resistors*_
 
The total equivalent resistance of these three series connected resistors is just $R_1$.  So the total power dissipated by *all four resistors* is therefore:

p=. $p_{total}$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2^}{R_1}$

And so for each of the four original resistors the power dissipated is 1/4 of this, or:

p=. $p_{resistor}$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2^}{4R_1}$

Finally, to design specific values for the resistances to be used we need to select the desired power level and supply voltage.  If we use 1/4 watt resistors, and if we are able to notice heating by touch at about 1/2 that rated power; then we should design for 1/8 watt dissipation _in each resistor_.

Hence for a supply voltage of Vs = 10 volts, and 1/8 watt power dissipation per resistor, the designed value of $R_1$ becomes:

p=. $R_1$ = $\frac{(V_S)^2}{4(1/8)}$  =  2 x 10^2$  =  200 ohms

and thus using eqâ€™n [9] we also design the $R_2$ value as:

p=. $R_2$ = $(\frac{1}{4})8(\frac{(V_S)^2}{4})$  =  50 ohms.

h4(#chapter7-2nd-four-resistor). 7.4 - 2nd Example: Four Resistor Equal Heating

A slightly different resistor configuration for the goal of uniform heating is depicted in "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7.

p=(#figure7-7). !{width:42%}img/7/circuitsF7.7.jpg(Figure 7.7)!:img/7/circuitsF7.7.jpg
_Figure 7.7  Equal Power Circuit Configuration II_

Note this circuit is a simplified view of a larger 'grid' of resistors that might be used to cause a large area of uniform heating, as shown in "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1. To solve the equal power condition for "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1 just requires more math compared to the solution for "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7.

The calculation process for Configuration II, "Figure 7.7":#figure7-7 proceeds by recognition that there are three resistors in series, $R_1$ and $R_2$ resistors.  Hence for equal power these three must all have the same value, namely $R_2 = R_1$.

The three series resistors exhibit an equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, of $3(R_1)$. And that equivalent resistance is in parallel with $R_3$.  Thus for all four resistors to dissipate equal power we need $R_3$ to dissipate 1/3 of the power dissipated by $R_{eq}$.  But the power dissipated in $R_3$ is just:

p=. $P_{R3}$  =  $V_S i_{R3}$  =  $V_S(\frac{V_S}{R_3})$

and we need to set the power dissipated by $R_{eq}$, to be $3P_{R3}$, so:

p=. $\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_{eq}}$  =  $3 P_{R3}$  =  $3()\frac{(V_S)^2}{R_3})$

However, from above $R_{eq} = 3R_1$, so by substitution:

p=. $\frac{(V_S)^2}{3R_1}$  =  $3\frac{(V_s)^2}{R_3}

So finally for equal power dissipation in all four resistors in Figure 7-7, we require:

p=. $R_2 = R_1$  and  $R_3 = 9 R_1$

More elaborate arrangements such as "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1 require repeated application of these basic constraint concepts.
