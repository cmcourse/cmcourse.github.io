Recall that power transfer is one of the major goals for electric circuits.  The electric-grid that supplies power to homes and industry is arranged for efficient power delivery from the source to the load.  But is this case the load is whatever a customer connects, so the source is designed to supply power to _all loads_ with minimal loss during delivery.  Power is also an important concern for communications circuits.  For example, when data is transmitted from a satellite to earth, due to the very limited power at the satellite it is extremely important to couple as much available signal power to the antenna for data transmission back to earth.  Furthermore, we may seek to minimize wasted power in portable electronics to achieve longer battery life.  Thus power is not only an issue for heating, motors, etc., but significant for data and information systems as well.

In this chapter we examine power in circuits, and use two specific problems to illustrate ways to understand the impact of power constraints on circuits.  Firstly, we will look at ways to distribute power uniformly over a desired set of resistor elements. This might occur when trying to make a uniformly heated surface.  For efficient communications it is often important to maximize the amount of signal captured from a source of limited power. Thus for our second example we seek to maximize the power transferred from a given source into a resistive load.

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.1 - Uniform Power Over Multiple Resistors

Here we seek to design a resistive circuit that dissipates a uniform amount of _heat per resistor_.  And furthermore we would like to do this on an array of multiple resistors.  Recall that the heat dissipation produced by a single resistor is the product of the voltage across the resistor times the current through the resistor (with our polarity convention).

p=. $p_{resistor} = (v_r) (i_r)$

Thus to achieve uniform heating over several resistors it is necessary to make _this product the same_ for each individual resistor in the heating network.  The individual currents and voltages may be different, _but for equal heating it is only their product that must be constant_.

One example is a spatially extended 'grid' of resistors, "Figure 7.1":#figure7-1, in a manner similar to that used to cause a large area of uniform defrost heating on the rear window of a car.

h4(#chapter7-uniform-power). 7.2 - Example: Two Resistor Uniform Heating

To better understand the uniform heating constraint, lets first consider a parallel two-resistor network connected to a constant voltage source as depicted in "Figure 7.2":#figure7-2.

p=(#figure7-2). !{width:40%}img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg(Figure 7.2)!:img/7/circuitsF7.2.jpg

The goal is to select the value of resistor $R_2$ in relation to resistor $R_1$, so that both resistors dissipate the _same power_.  To do this we need to equate the power dissipated in each resistor, equation [7.1].

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1)(i_1) = p_2 = (v_2)(i_2)$

where, $i_1$ and $i_2$ are the currents in resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively, and $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the voltages _across_ $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively.  But here the two resistors are connected in parallel, to same node-pair, an equal voltage connection.  Hence $v_1 = v_2$.  Also they are in parallel with the voltage source $V_S$, so by substitution: $v_1 = v_2$ = $V_S$, and thus, equation [2].

p=. $(V_S i_1) = (V_S i_2)$

Hence to get equal power dissipated by these 2 _parallel_ resistors we need $i_1 = i_2$.  Now for each resistor we can apply ohm's law, this leads to the obvious answer: when  , there is equal power dissipated in both resistors.

Alternately the two resistors could be connected in series, a single path (equal current), see "Figure 7.3":#figure7-3.

p=(#figure7-3). !{width:35%}img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg(Figure 7.3)!:img/7/circuitsF7.3.jpg

Again for equal power the product of voltage-across and current-in each resistor must be the same, hence:

p=. $p_{resistor} = p_1 = (v_1 i_1) = p_2 = (v_2 i_2)$

but, since a series circuit; $i_1 = i_2 = i$ :

p=. $(v_1 i) = (v_2 i)$

So both resistors must have the same voltage, $v$, but they have the same current, so

p=. $R_1 = (frac\{v}{i}) = R_2$

Again to get equal power dissipation the two resistor values need to be equal, $R_1 = R_2$ .
