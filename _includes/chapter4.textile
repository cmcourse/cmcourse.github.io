At this point we have determined that all circuits constrain two variables, voltage and current in order to cause a transfer of power or information from an electric source to an electric load.  The constraints are imposed in two ways: (1) by the specific properties of individual _circuit elements_ each constrain voltage and current at that element only, *and* (2) independently by the inherent _conservation laws_ that constrain how voltages and currents must be distributed amongst multiple elements connected in a circuit.

How we actually solve for all the voltages and currents in a circuit is the topic of this section.  At first we look at a fully general method of solution, which is based on direct application of all constraints, but becomes awkward for large circuits.  Then we develop a very convenient, powerful and universal solution method, called the _node method_.  For completeness another solution method, called the mesh method is also presented.

In general a circuit of N elements will involve 2N variables, the N voltages across each element and the N currents through each element.  For example, the circuit in "Figure 4.1":#figure4-1 has 4 elements connected in a single loop and hence a total of 8 variable values to be determined by the circuit analysis. The 2N variables are the 4 element-voltages,$V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$, and $V_4$ (across each element), and the 4 individual element-currents of $i_1$, $i_2$, $i_3$, and $i_4$ (through each element).

To obtain the needed 2N equations we apply (1) the constitutive constraints for ALL the individual elements, and then (2) the Kirchoff Conservation Law constraints to corresponding groups of elements.  The complete combination of constraints always yields a complete set of 2N independent equations for the 2N unknown voltage and current values. For the above example circuit, "Figure 4.1":#figure4-1, we therefore have eight constraint equations for the 8 unknowns as follows:

# Element Constitutive Constraints:
## At Resistor R1: $V_1 = R_1 i_1$
## At Resistor R2: $V_2 = R_2 i_2$
## At Resistor R3: $V_3 = R_3 i_3$
## At Fixed Voltage Source: $V_4 = V_S$
# Conservation Law Constraints: KCL:
## At Node n1: $i_1 + i_4 = 0$
## At Node n2: $-i_1 + i_2 = 0$
## At Node n3: $-i_2 - i_3 = 0$
# Conservation Law Constraints: KVL:
## Around Loop 1: $-V_4 + V_1 + V_2 - V_3 = 0$

Note the assignment of the element voltage polarity was arbitrary, BUT once the voltage polarity is defined then the current direction MUST be set consistently, with current defined into the “+” terminal.  There is not an independent KCL equation at node n4, since the sum of the three other node equations is the same as that at node n4.  [In general there are always only (N-1) node equations where N is the total number of nodes.]

These eight equations can be solved for the 8 element voltage and current values.  Finally these solution values can then be used to calculate additional values of interest such as power dissipated by an element or the total voltage across several elements.
