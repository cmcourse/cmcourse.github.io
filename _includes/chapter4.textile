At this point we have determined that all circuits constrain two variables, voltage and current in order to cause a transfer of power or information from an electric source to an electric load.  The constraints are imposed in two ways: (1) by the specific properties of individual _circuit elements_ each constrain voltage and current at that element only, *and* (2) independently by the inherent _conservation laws_ that constrain how voltages and currents must be distributed amongst multiple elements connected in a circuit.

How we actually solve for all the voltages and currents in a circuit is the topic of this section.  At first we look at a fully general method of solution, which is based on direct application of all constraints, but becomes awkward for large circuits.  Then we develop a very convenient, powerful and universal solution method, called the _node method_.  For completeness another solution method, called the mesh method is also presented.

h4(#chapter4-general-soln). 4.1 - General Method of Solution

In general a circuit of N elements will involve 2N variables, the N voltages across each element and the N currents through each element.  For example, the circuit in "Figure 4.1":#figure4-1 has 4 elements connected in a single loop and hence a total of 8 variable values to be determined by the circuit analysis. The 2N variables are the 4 element-voltages,$V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$, and $V_4$ (across each element), and the 4 individual element-currents of $i_1$, $i_2$, $i_3$, and $i_4$ (through each element), _keeping polarity consistent_.

_Figure 4.1  Example Circuit with 4 Elements Connected in One Loop_

To obtain the needed 2N equations we apply (1) the constitutive constraints for ALL the individual elements, and then (2) the Kirchoff Conservation Law constraints to corresponding groups of elements.  The complete combination of constraints always yields a complete set of 2N independent equations for the 2N unknown voltage and current values. For the above example circuit, "Figure 4.1":#figure4-1, we therefore have eight constraint equations for the 8 unknowns as follows:

# Element Constitutive Constraints:
** At Resistor R1: $V_1 = R_1 i_1$
** At Resistor R2: $V_2 = R_2 i_2$
** At Resistor R3: $V_3 = R_3 i_3$
** At Fixed Voltage Source: $V_4 = V_S$
# Conservation Law Constraints: KCL:
** At Node n1: $i_1 + i_4 = 0$
** At Node n2: $-i_1 + i_2 = 0$
** At Node n3: $-i_2 - i_3 = 0$
# Conservation Law Constraints: KVL:
** Around Loop 1: $-V_4 + V_1 + V_2 - V_3 = 0$

Note the assignment of the element voltage polarity was arbitrary, BUT once the voltage polarity is defined then the current direction MUST be set consistently, with current defined into the '+' terminal.  There is not an independent KCL equation at node n4, since the sum of the three other node equations is the same as that at node n4.  [In general there are always only (N-1) node equations where N is the total number of nodes.]

These eight equations can be solved for the 8 element voltage and current values.  Finally these solution values can then be used to calculate additional values of interest such as power dissipated by an element or the total voltage across several elements.

h4(#chapter4-general-example-5elements). 4.2 - Numerical Example, 5-Element Circuit

A 5-element circuit (4 nodes) is now considered with numerical values, "Figure 4.2":#figure4-2, where we already label all element voltage and element current values (_polarity consistent !!_).

p=(#figure4-2). !{width:50%}img/4/circuitsF4.2.jpg(Figure 4.2)!:img/4/circuitsF4.2.jpg
_Figure 4.2  Example Circuit of 5-Elements with Numerical Values_

The element constitutive constraints are:

# The element constitutive constraints are:
** At Resistor R1: $V_1 = 2 i_1$
** At Resistor R2: $V_2 = 3 i_2$
** At Resistor R3: $V_3 = 1 i_3$
** At Fixed Voltage Source: $V_4 = 6$
** At Fixed Current Source: $i_5 = 1$

Where all currents are in units of milliamps and resistances in kilohms.

# The conservation law constraints; by KCL:
** At Node n1: $i_1 + i_4 = 0$
** At Node n2: $-i_1 + i_2 = 0$
** At Node n3: $-i_2 - i_3 = 0$
# The conservation law constraints; by KVL:
** Around Loop 1: $-V_4 + V_1 + V_2 = 0$
** Around Loop 2: $-V_2 + V_5 + V_3 = 0$

Thus we have 10 equations for the 10 unknowns, and with algebra they can be solved.  The 4th KCL equation at node n4 is redundant and hence not written since it equals the sum of the KCL equations at the other 3 nodes. And the 3rd  KVL equation around the 'outer loop' of elements $( -V_4 + V_1 + V_5 + V_3 = 0)$ is also redundant and hence not written since it is the same as the sum of the other two KVL loops.  There are always (N-1) KCL node equations, where N is the number of nodes, and (M-1) KVL loop equations, where M is the total number of loops (loop = 'mesh').

h4(#chapter4-node-method). 4.3 - The 'Node Voltage Method'

Notice in the general solution method above, we calculated the element voltages and the element current all by one set of equations.  We now employ a simplification of the solution process by 'directly' writing a reduced set of equations, _written in terms of the unknown node voltages only_.  This solution method does not directly calculate element voltages.

The _node-voltage method_ breaks the total solution of all element voltages and currents into separate smaller parts.  In this way one need not calculate element values that are not of interest and more directly solve for specific desired quantities.  The small set of node voltage values are often an intermediate step since individual branch voltages are determined subsequently from the difference of node voltages; also element currents can be determined from the known voltages, and element characteristics.  In this manner all voltage and current values of the original problem can be calculated as needed.

We organize the node-method solution process into 4 steps:

# Identification and label all unknown node-voltage variables,
** select one node as the reference node (ground)
# Write the KCL equations at each unknown node in terms of the node voltages,
# Solve the set of equations for the node voltages, and finally
# Calculate the variables of interest:
** element or group voltages
** element currents
** power dissipated in elements

Specifically the 4-steps are:

# *STEP 1:*  Identification/label of node-voltage variables
** (a) select a reference node and set itâ€™s voltage to zero (ground)
** (b) label all other unknown node voltages
# *STEP 2:*  Write KCL constraint equations for all nodes via unknown node voltages
** (a) write each KCL branch current according to element constraints
# *STEP 3:*  Solve the resulting set of equations for all node voltage values
** (a) these will be linear equations for our problems
** (b) solve sequentially or by matrix methods
** (\c) if non-linear, then iterative/computer solution is required
# *STEP 4:*  Calculate particular individual variable or values of interest
** (a) element voltages
** (b) element currents
** (\c) power dissipated by an element
** (d) groups of voltages, currents

We can illustrate the process of this 'node method' using the same 4-node, 5-element problem as in Section 4.2 and "Figure 4.2":#figure4-2,.  Now redrawn in "Figure 4.3":#figure4-3, with the unknown node voltages labeled, and the 'ground' reference node identified as node $n_4$, and hence $v_{n4} = 0$.  For clarity in writing KCL constraints the branch current are identified.

p=(#figure4-3). !{width:50%}img/4/circuitsF4.3.jpg(Figure 4.3)!:img/4/circuitsF4.3.jpg
_Figure 4.3  Example 4-Node Circuit, Labeled for Node-Voltage Method of Solution_

*STEP 1:*

We have labeled the three nodes voltages: $v_{n1}, v_{n2}$, and $v_{n3}$, where the reference node is $v_{n4} = 0$.  However, the node voltage $v_{n1}$ is already fixed at the value of 6 volts due to the constraint imposed by the voltage source.  Thus in this example problem there are actually only 2 unknown node voltages, $v_{n2}$ and $v_{n3}$.  So the node-voltage method has reduced the number of variables from 10 in the 'general method' of solution to just 2 variables.  Hence in this 'node-voltage' method we will need only 2 independent equations and the algebra effort required for solution is greatly reduced.

*STEP 2:*

We write the KCL equations for each of the two nodes with unknown voltages.  In this case these are for the two node voltages, $v_{n2}$ and $v_{n3}$.

The two KCL equations _at these nodes_ in terms of the branch currents are: [Here currents are in units of milliamps and resistance values will be in kilohms.]

p=. At node n2: $-i_1 + i_2 + i_5 = 0$       and

p=. At node n3: $1 + i_3 = 0$   or   $i_3 = 1$

Where by the current source constraint we already know that:

p=. $i_5 = 1$

Now in this node-voltage method of solution we write the currents in these KCL equations in terms of the node voltages by _direct application of the element constitutive constraints for the currents_.  And we express the element voltages as the difference of two node voltage values.  Hence we write the resistive element currents as:

p=. $i_1 = (6-v_{n2})/2$

p=. $i_2 = (v_{n2}-0)/3$

p=. $i_3 = (v_{n3}-0)/1$

By substitution into the KCL we get the following two equations for the node voltages:

p=. At node n2: $-(6-v_{n2})/2 + (v_{n2} - 0)/3 +1 = 0$

p=. At node n3: $1+(v_{n3} -0)/1 = 0$

Since $V_{S1}, I_{S2}, R_1, R_2$, and $R_3$ are all known element values we can easily collect terms in these two equations for $v_{n2}$ and $v_{n3}$ :

p=. $v_{n2}(1/2 + 1/3) = 6/2 - 1 = 2$ volts

p=. $v_{n3} =$ (1mA) (1kohm) = 1 volt

*STEP 3:*

Solving for node voltages

p=. $v_{n2} = (6/5)(3-1) = 12/5$ volts

and

p=. $v_{n3} = 1$ volt

*STEP 4:*

All three node voltages are now known.  By substitution into the resistor constraints and by KCL (and the current source constraint) we can now calculate the 5 currents (where we know i5 = 1mA), as:

At $R_1$:

p=. $i_1 = (v_{n1} - v_{n2})R_3$ = $(6-(12/5))/2k = (30-12)/10k = 9/5$ mA

p=. $i_2 = (v_{n2} - 0)/R_2$ = $(12/5)/3k = 1$ mA

p=. $i_3 = (v_{n3} - 0)/R_3$ = $(1 - 0)/1k = 1$ mA

Note the fixed voltage source DOES NOT constrain the current i4, so we must calculate this current value by application of KCL at nodes n1.

p=. At node $n_1$: $i_4 + i_1 = 0$

So the $i_4$ current is:

p=. $i_4 = -i_1 = -9/5$ mA.

We can check the answers by confirmation of KCL at node n2:

p=.  $-i_1 - i_2 + i_5 = 0$

substitute:

p=. $-(9/5) + (4/5) + (1) =  0$  good, confirmed with KCL.

We can also calculate the power dissipated in the three resistor elements.

p=. $P_{R1} = (6-v_{N2})(i_1) = ((30-12)/5)$ volt (9/5) mA = 162/25  milliWatt

p=. $P_{R2} = (v_{n2} - 0)(i_2) = (12/5)(4/5) = 48/25$ milliwatt

p=. $P_{R3} = (v_{n3} - 0)(i_3) = (1)(1) = 1$ milliwatt

The total power dissipated in the entire circuit is:

p=. $(162/25)-(270/25) + (35/25) + 1 + (48/25) = (270-270)/25 = 0$

Notice that the sum of the power dissipated in ALL 5 elements is 0 watts !!  This is expected from the total power dissipated constraint = 0, see Section 3.3.

The node-voltage method is usually most convenient for hand calculations since it immediately solves for the node voltages. It is then straight-forward to calculate any specific quantity, such as an element voltage, current or power.  This makes a very favorable way to minimize the effort to determine just the quantity desired.


h4(#chapter4-mesh-method). 4.4 - The 'Mesh Loop Method'

Because the preceding node methods are most often the preferred methods of solution to understand circuits they will be the dominant method for our circuit studies.  However, it is worth noting for completeness that there is an alternate method of solution termed the _'mesh loop method'_.  [Also sometimes called the 'mesh' method.]

The mesh method, instead of relying on KCL, the current constraint at nodes, uses the KVL (Kirchoffâ€™s Voltage Law) conservation constraint on the individual element voltages.  Thus the mesh method takes the sum of element voltages around all independent loops, where each such loop voltage must (by KVL) sum to zero.  This is illustrated for the example problem of Section 4.2 recast here in "Figure 4.4":#figure4-4.

p=(#figure4-4). !{width:52%}img/4/circuitsF4.4.jpg(Figure 4.4)!:img/4/circuitsF4.4.jpg
_Figure 4.4  Loop Meshes in Example Problem_

Note here we consider all _individual element voltages_, $V_{R1}, V_{R2}$, etc., and loop currents $i_A$ and $i_B$ , and *not* the individual element currents nor node voltages.  For the loops, there is a 3rd possible loop, Loop-C, that follows the 'exterior' path around $R_1$, I_{S2}, R_3$, and $V_{S1}$.  However, it is not an independent since Loop-A and Loop-B already involve all those elements, so loop-C has no new information and is therefore redundant and not needed.

The loop equations (_sum voltage drops_) for these two independent meshes are, for:

Loop A, clockwise:

p=. $-v_{R1} + v_{R2} - v_{S1} = 0$  and

Loop B, clockwise:

p=. $- v_{R2} + v_{S2} + v_{R3} = 0$

While these equations appear simple, the difficulty with the mesh method is that there are additional variables that must be calculated. _The loop currents are *not necessarily* the element currents_.  So the loop current variables calculated are not always the variables of interest.  [Recall with the node method, the variables were always the node voltages and elements currents, both are the variables of interest.]

For example with the above Loop-A and Loop-B, the element current in resistor $R_1$, according to the element polarity convention, is just $-i_A$. Even more confusing, the current in the center resistor $R_2$ has two parts: $i_A$ AND $i_B$, so the actual real current in $R_2$ is the _*difference*_ of two currents: $(i_A - i_B)$, a major inconvenience and complication !

With this method we get the following equations:

For Loop-A:

p=. $-(-i_A)(R_1) + (i_A - i_B)(R_2) - V_{S1} = 0$

For Loop-B:

p=. $V_{S2} + (i_B)(R_3) - (i_A - i_B)(R_2) = 0$

and the current source, $I_{S2}$, is the Loop-B current $i_B$.  We can solve these for the loop currents.  Then the element voltage can be calculated.  So even for this small example, the mesh method, although it can achieve a complete solution, is not as effective as the node method.

*** _Special Case Loop Method_

There is one exception where the loop method can be very useful and important to know; occasionally it is helpful to find a specific voltage on one element _when all other voltages around a loop are already known_.  The KVL loop in this case with a single unknown is a very effective method.

We can use the loop method in the example depicted in Figure 4.5.  Here suppose we seek only to calculate the voltage across resistor R3.  "Figure 4.5":#figure4-5 depicts a Loop-C, which enable rapid calculation of vR3, because the other voltages in that loop are already known.


p=(#figure4-5). !{width:45%}img/4/circuitsF4.5.jpg(Figure 4.5)!:img/4/circuitsF4.5.jpg
_Figure 4.5  Single Element Voltage Solution by a KVL Loop Method_
 
So in this case we can write KVL voltage-drops around Loop-C as:

p=. $-V_{S1} - V_{S2} + v_{R3} = 0$

Therefore with example numerical values, $V_{S1} = 8$ volts, and $V_{S2} = 4$ volts, then

p=. $v_{R3} = + V_{S1} + V_{S2} = 12$  volts

In this particular case with a single unknown voltage in a loop, the loop method has been very effective.

Thus, we need to keep in mind the loop method as a useful tool for solving very specific certain kinds of problems (single voltage in a known loop).  But most often the direct node-voltage method will be used to develop both solutions and understanding as to how a circuit works and to obtain specific answer values.
