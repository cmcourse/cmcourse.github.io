All circuit elements are physical pieces of hardware that use the electric variables of voltage and current.  By 'use' we mean that each element provides a well-defined relationship between voltage and current at the connections to the element.  This relationship is in fact the 'Rule-1' type _constraint_, which applies to voltage and current _at that element_.  Said another way, each circuit element forces a very specific and known relationship between voltage and current _at that element_.  Here 'device' and 'element' are the same with no difference in meaning.

From an abstract circuit point of view, _we need not_ know how (or even the exact physical processes involved in how) the circuit element actually achieves the voltage-current constraint.  We only need to know the constraint relationship in order to analyze a circuit.

h4(#chapter2-volt-constraint). 2.1 - Fixed Voltage Source Constraint, ('Source' Circuit Element)

Consider an example circuit element, a practical 2-terminal element constraint, the Fixed Voltage Source Constraint.  The fixed voltage source circuit element, by it's physical structure, forces a very distinctive relationship between voltage and current, namely the voltage across the two terminals of the source is always a fixed constant value independent of the current passing through the source. We need the value of the voltage constant '$V_S$'.  The voltages and current for this element are depicted in "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1.

p=(#figure2-1). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.1.jpg(Figure 2.1)!:img/2/circuitsF2.1.jpg
_Figure 2.1  The Fixed Voltage Source Circuit Element, with Value '$V_S$'_

The mathematical form of the constraint, which this voltage source imposes between voltage and current at it’s terminals is given by Eq'n. 2.1.

$(V_n_1  - V_n_2  - V_S) = 0$   Eq'n 2.1

Eq'n 2.1 simple states the voltage difference between node 1 and node 2, $(v_n_1 - v_n_2)$, is a fixed constant value of '$V_S$', and does not change with the current in the source, $i_S$.

Another way to represent the constraint imposed by this element is graphically, where the element current, $i_S$ , is depicted versus the element voltage, $(v_n1 – v_n2)$.  "Figure 2.2":#figure2-2 shows in graphical form the element current, $i_S$ , versus element voltage, where the element voltage is just the node voltage difference $(v_n_1  –  v_n_2)$, recall Section 1.6 for this definition.

p=(#figure2-2). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.2.jpg(Figure 2.2)!:img/2/circuitsF2.2.jpg
_Figure 2.2  Fixed Voltage Source Element Constraint, Graphical Presentation_

Notice, for this fixed voltage source the element voltage, $(v_n1 – v_n2)$, is always fixed at the value $V_S$, and is completely independent of the element current, $i_S$, magnitude or polarity.  By convention, the fixed voltage source element is always represented by a circle with +/- signs to identify polarity as in "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1.  A positive value for $V_S$, means the voltage at node 1 is greater than the voltage at node 2.

h4(#chapter2-volt-constraint). 2.2 - Circuit Element Conventions

In the above fixed voltage source element there were important conventions that were employed and are now adopted for all our circuit elements. Three conventions to consider are:

bq. *1*  *Nodes*:  Firstly we speak of a *'node'*.  A node is a connection point in a circuit, and by definition has a single value of voltage.  Here in "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1, node 1 is one connection point to the fixed voltage source circuit element, and node 2 is the second connection point to the same element.  All circuit elements have two or more connection nodes.  More than one element may be connected to a node..

bq. *2*  *Direction*:  Another convention used here and in ALL circuits is that current has a direction and the *direction* of positive current is shown by an _'arrow'_.  Here the current in the voltage source element is identified as $i_S$, and a positive value of current $i_S$ will go in the direction of the arrow, here *from* left-*to*-right in "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1 as identified by the direction of the current arrow.  See also Section 1.6.

bq. *3*  *Polarity*:  And finally we adopt a common *polarity* convention for all circuit elements, we ALWAYS place the _positive current direction into an element at the positive terminal of the element._  Here in "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1, this means the current arrow, $i_S$, is (and must be) pointed to the positive side of the fixed voltage source, $V_S$.  See also Section 1.6.

These three conventions can be demonstrated by considering a general circuit element as shown in "Figure 2.3":#figure2-3.

p=(#figure2-3). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.3.jpg(Figure 2.3)!:img/2/circuitsF2.3.jpg
_Figure 2.3  A General Circuit Element with Circuit Element Conventions_

Here these conventions are applied to the general element by (1) electrical connections with two nodes, node 1 and node 2; (2) the element current, iX, is defined by the arrow direction to be from left-to-right when positive, and (3) the element current, $i_X$, direction arrow is pointed toward the positive terminal for the _element voltage_, $V_X$.  Note mathematically the element voltage, $V_X$, is simply the difference of the voltage at node 1 minus the voltage at node 2, Eq'n 2.2.

$(V_n1 - V_n2) = V_X$       Eq'n 2.2

These conventions for nodes, currents and polarity apply independent of the physical orientation or graphical drawing of an element, see "Figure 2.4":#figure2-4.  Both of these representations for an element are consistent with the above three element conventions.

p=(#figure2-4). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.4.jpg(Figure 2.4)!:img/2/circuitsF2.4.jpg

h4(#chapter2-element-power). 2.3 - Power in Circuit Elements

The reason for the polarity convention, where positive current direction is *always* pointed into the defined positive voltage terminal on the element is to have a consistent definition of power.  This is because power is the _product of current times voltage_.  So with the polarity convention we can ALWAYS state that the *power dissipated* by an element is just the product $i_X$ * $v_X$,  or  $v_X$ * $i_X$, Eq'n 2.3.

$P_X = v_X * i_X$      Eq'n 2.3

Power is in units of watts when the voltage is in units of volts, and current is in units of amperes.  Electric power is 'dissipated' has the meaning that a _positive value_ of the product represent power $(v_X$ $i_X)$ consumed by the element [and converted from electrical energy into some other form of energy; for example heat, or mechanical motion if a motor].  Power is often a very important practical and useful quantity.  It also represents wasted energy if the element yields heat when it is not a desired outcome of the circuit.

A _negative value_ for the power 'dissipated' corresponds to _power supplied by the element_.  Hence a power source is usually intended to supply power so in such cases the power dissipated by the source element would be negative.  For example, if $i_X$ is negative and $v_X$ is positive we get a negative power dissipated, and hence a power source. For the Fixed Voltage Source element, "Figure 2.1":#figure2-1, this element supplies power for negative values of element current $i_S$. Note when $i_S$ is positive then the source instead dissipates power !

We can obtain further understanding of this current-voltage-power relationship by a graphical plot.  "Figure 2.5":#figure2-5 depicts the current, $i_X$, and voltage $v_X$, for our general circuit element.  Power dissipated is positive, $v_X * i_X > 0$, (lost; does work, heating, a load) in the 1st and 3rd quadrants, and negative, $v_X * i_X < 0$, (supplied, a source) in the 2nd and 4th quadrants.

h4(#chapter2-element-resistor). 2.4 - The Resistor Element Constraint, (a 'Load' Type Circuit Element)

Consider another example of a practical 2-terminal element constraint, the Resistor Constraint.  The resistor circuit element, by it's physical structure, forces a very distinctive relation between voltage and current, namely the voltage across the two terminals of a resistor is _proportional to the current passing through the resistor_.  The proportionality constant is represented by the value $'R'$, a constant for each resistor.  The voltages, current, and symbol for this element are depicted in "Figure 2.6":#figure2-6.

p=(#figure2-6). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.6.jpg(Figure 2.6)!:img/2/circuitsF2.6.jpg
_Figure 2.6  The Resistor Circuit Element with Resistance $'R'$_

The direction of the element current is chosen (as always) to be consistent with our required element conventions, here positive element current, $i_R$, is into the element from the $v_n_1$ node of the voltage difference of $(v_n_1-v_n_2)$.  With this polarity convention, the mathematical formulation for the element constraint imposed by a resistor, is given by Eq'n. 2.4.

$(v_n_1  - v_n_2) - i_R R = 0$   Eq'n 2.4

Here and for all voltages and currents we need to use a consistent set of units.  Current is expressed in the standard unit of _amperes_, while voltage is expressed in the standard unit of _volts_ for all our circuit elements.  In the case of the resistor the constant $'R'$ is in the units of _ohms_. $R$ is called the resistance value of the resistor.  Eq'n 2.4 is also known as Ohms Law.

Graphically, we can represent a resistor as current versus the element voltage $(v_n_1 – v_n_2)$, as depicted in "Figure 2.7":#figure2-7.  Notice the current-voltage values are ALWAYS constraint to be in the 1st and 3rd quadrants when R is positive; and hence, _power is always dissipated_ by any resistor with a positive value of resistance $R$ (see also "Figure 2.5":#figure2-5)

p=(#figure2-7). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.7.jpg(Figure 2.7)!:img/2/circuitsF2.7.jpg
_Figure 2.7  The Resistor Element Constraint, Graphical Presentation_

h4(#chapter2-element-current). 2.5 - The Fixed Current Source Constraint, (a 'Source' Type Circuit Element)

Consider a third example of a practical 2-terminal element constraint, the Fixed Current Source Constraint.  A fixed current source is similar to a fixed voltage source in concept, except for the current source, the current $I_S$ is fixed, and this current value is independent of the voltage across the current source.  The voltages, current and symbol for this element are depicted in "Figure 2.8":#figure2-8.

p=(#figure2-8). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.8.jpg(Figure 2.8)!:img/2/circuitsF2.8.jpg
_Figure 2.8  The Fixed Current Source Circuit Element, $'I_S'$_

The mathematical form of the constraint, which this fixed current source imposes between voltage and current at it's terminals is given by Eq'n. 2.5.  Again we keep the element polarity convention that positive current is defined into the positive polarity of the element voltage, $v_S$.  The direction of the currrent $I_S$ is defined by the arrow in the current source.


$i_S - I_S = 0$     Eq'n 2.5

This Eq'n. 2.5 simply states the current from node 1 to node 2 is a constant fixed value of $I_S$ amperes, and *does not change with the amount of voltage across the element source*, $(v_n_1 – v_n_2) = v_S$.

Another way to represent the constraint imposed by this element, on the element current, $i_S$ , and element voltage, $(v_n_1 – v_n_2)$, is to present the relationship graphically.  "Figure 2.9":#figure2-9 shows in graphical form the element current, $i_S$ , versus element voltage, the node voltage difference $(v_n_1 – v_n_2)$.

p=(#figure2-9). !{width:50%}img/2/circuitsF2.9.jpg(Figure 2.9)!:img/2/circuitsF2.9.jpg
_Figure 2.9  Fixed Current Source Element Constraint, Graphical Presentation_

Notice for this fixed current source the element current, $(i_S = I_S)$, is always fixed at the value $I_S$, independent of the element voltage, $v_S$, magnitude or polarity.  Again by convention, the fixed current source element is always represented by a circle with an arrow sign as depicted in "Figure 2.8":#figure2-8.

h4(#chapter2-element-constitutive). 2.6 - Element Constitutive (Constraint) Relations

We have seen examples of the fact that all circuit elements provide very specific constraints on the _voltages and current *associated with that element*_.  These element constraints are sometimes given a name called the 'constitutive relations'. They are one form of constraint used to analyze circuits.  Recall from Section 1.5 there are two basic rules, 'Rule 1' is for these constitutive constraints caused by elements, whereas 'Rule 2' is for constraints associate with how multiple elements are connected together, see Chapter 3.

h4(#chapter2-element-constitutive). 2.7 - Conclusions

We can summarize the constraints imposed by 'Rule 1' (Circuit Element Constraints) by collecting the constitutive relations for each kind of element.  For the three kinds of elements we have discussed so far; the fixed voltage source, the resistor, and the fixed current source we thus have the following constitutive relations in Table 2.1.

bq. *Table 2.1*
    *Constitutive Relations: Fixed Sources and Resistors*

bq. Fixed Voltage Source:  $(v_n1 - v_n2) - V_S = 0$

bq. Resistor:  $(v_n1 - v_n2) - i_R R = 0$

bq. Fixed Current Source:  $i_S - I_S = 0$

These relations establish the constraints imposed by these three circuit elements.  We additionally *always* use our three element conventions of element voltages, current direction, and polarity in order to accurately represent the constraints of each element.

We will find there are more circuit elements that we will use in the future, however, we can already do a substantial amount of circuit analysis with just two elements, the fixed voltage source and the resistor.  In the next section we examine the 'Rule 2' constraints associated with circuit connections.
