In this section we apply our knowledge of constraints for elements (the constitutive relations), and the constraints for circuits (KCL and KVL) to examine two major circuit topologies that appear repeatedly in many practical circuits.  By circuit topology we refer to a specific arrangement of circuit elements.  The two arrangements here involve specific _restrictions_, ones that simplify our work and enable a very rapid evaluation once the configuration is correctly recognized.  It is also true that incorrect assessment of the configuration will result in an incorrect result, so it is really important to understand the two specific types of restrictions that we consider in this section.


h4(#chapter5-series-restriction). 5.1 - Series Connection: Single-Loop Restriction


Consider the first special topology the _single loop_ circuit structure, see "Figure 5.1":#figure5-1.  Here we mean that all elements of the circuit are connected so they form a single loop.  Because the circuit is a single loop, and because of our KCL current law, there can be only one current in all elements in the loop.  "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a depicts this arrangement, called a series connection.

_Figure 5.1a  _

In the series circuit, "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a, all 4 elements are connected end-to-end to form a _single loop_.  There is a single current, '$i$', in the circuit.  This current, '$i$', passes _equally_ through resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$, and fixed voltage source $V_S$.  There is no other path for curent in this current, so KCL requires current, $i$, must be of _*equal* value in all 4 elements_.
