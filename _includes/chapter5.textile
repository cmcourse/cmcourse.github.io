In this section we apply our knowledge of constraints for elements (the constitutive relations), and the constraints for circuits (KCL and KVL) to examine two major circuit topologies that appear repeatedly in many practical circuits.  By circuit topology we refer to a specific arrangement of circuit elements.  The two arrangements here involve specific _restrictions_, ones that simplify our work and enable a very rapid evaluation once the configuration is correctly recognized.  It is also true that incorrect assessment of the configuration will result in an incorrect result, so it is really important to understand the two specific types of restrictions that we consider in this section.


h4(#chapter5-series-restriction). 5.1 - Series Connection: Single-Loop Restriction


Consider the first special topology the _single loop_ circuit structure, see "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a.  Here we mean that all elements of the circuit are connected so they form a single loop.  Because the circuit is a single loop, and because of our KCL current law, there can be only one current in all elements in the loop.  "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a depicts this arrangement, called a series connection.

table(#figure5-1).

|\2=. _Figure 5.1  Series Connection_ |

In the series circuit, "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a, all 4 elements are connected end-to-end to form a _single loop_.  There is a single current, '$i$', in the circuit.  This current, '$i$', passes _equally_ through resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$, and fixed voltage source $V_S$.  There is no other path for curent in this current, so KCL requires current, $i$, must be of _*equal* value in all 4 elements_.

However, if we now add another element so that there is NOT a single loop, but instead two (or more) loops, see "Figure 5.1b":#figure5-1b; then due to KCL at node n2, the current '$i_1$' is NOT the same in all 5 elements.  The added resistor $R_4$ in "Figure 5.1b":#figure5-1b causes the current '$i_1$' to split so a portion, '$i_2$', continues on to go through $R_2$ and $R_3$; and a portion, '$i_4$', branches through $R_4$.  In Figure 5.1b, it is no longer true that the same current '$i_1$' passes through all elements.  This non-equal current is the direct consequence of there being _more than a single loop_.  That $i_2$ cannot not equal $i_1$ in Figure 5.1b, is proved by KCL at node n2:

p=. $-i_1 + i_2 + i_4 = 0$

Since $i_4$ is not zero, this means the current, $i_2$, in resistors $R_2$ and $R_3$ cannot equal that in resistor $R_1$.

So the single-loop circuit restriction causes a special result, all currents must be equal.  A _'series connection'_ of elements thus simply means those elements in series are connected such that they all have the _same current.  If the elements do not have the same current, those elements cannot be in 'series'_.

** _5.1.1 A Single Loop Circuit Example: the Voltage Divider_

Lets consider a circuit with 3 elements as depicted in "Figure 5.2":#figure5-2.  This circuit has a single loop with a fixed voltage source and 2 resistors.  Because the 2 resistors are in the same loop we will know they must have the same current, I = iR1 = iR2, and are in series.

p=(#figure5-2). !{width:25%}img/5/circuitsF5.2.jpg(Figure 5.2)!:img/5/circuitsF5.2.jpg
_Figure 5.2  Example Circuit, 3 Elements in Single Loop_

Now we employ our node-method of circuit solution to solve this circuit.

*STEP-1:*

In this circuit we have already selected the reference node (n3) and set the voltage of it to zero.  This is indicated by the 'ground' symbol at node n3, which means the node is connected to zero volts, $v_{n3} = 0$.  All currents and node voltages have also been labeled.

*STEP-2:*

We write the conservation law constraints, KCL, and directly apply the resistor constitutive constraints to express the current values.

p=. At node n2: $-i_{R1} + i_{R2} = 0$

And by substitution:

p=. %{font-size:18pt}3x%

p=. $\frac{-(v_{n1} - v_{n2})}{R_1}$

p=. $%{font-size:18pt}\frac{3x}{2y}5z$%

p=. $\int\frac{1}{2}dx - \mathlarger{\int\frac{1}{3}dy}$

p=. $(-(v_{n1} - v_{n2})/R_1) + ((v_{n2} - 0)/R_2) = 0$

additionally, because of the constraint by the fixed voltage source at node n1 to node n3:

p=. $(v_{n1} - 0) - V_S = 0$,   so

p=. $v_{n1} = v_{S}$

divide by R1:  $(v_{n1}/R_1) = (V_S/R_1)$

and substitute: $v_{n2}((1/R_1) + (1/R_2)) = V_S/R_1$

so finally:

p=. $v_{n2} = (R_2/(R_1 + R_2))V_S$

This result reveals that while the voltage at node n1 is the source voltage, $V_S$, the voltage at node n2, $v_{n2}$, is a _constant fraction_ of the fixed source voltage $V_S$.  The fraction value is determined only by the resistor resistance values $R_1$ and $R_2$.

This fixed fraction single-loop circuit, is often termed a _*voltage divider*_, and is a very common circuit.  It is a single loop circuit with _two resistors connected in *series*_.  Lets clearly identify the voltage divider configuration.  Both circuits in "Figure 5.3":#figure5-3 are the same voltage divider configuration, just arranged differently, and both circuits yield exactly the same outcome.  There is _one loop_ in each and hence there is a single current, $i$, that passes through all three circuit elements.

p=(#figure5-3). !{width:75%}img/5/circuitsF5.3.jpg(Figure 5.3)!:img/5/circuitsF5.3.jpg
_Figure 5.3  Two Identical Representations of the Voltage Divider Circuit_

Furthermore, here in order to emphasis the voltage of interest, the '_output voltage_, $V_{out}$, these figures explicitly show the connection across resistor $R_2$ exaggerated.  Two '_open observation wires_' contact each node at the ends of resistor $R_2$.  BUT because these wire extensions DO NOT FORM A LOOP, _they carry zero current_ and do not change the voltage across $R_2$ !!  Thus $V_{out}$ is exactly the same as the voltage across $R_2$, $v_{n2}$.

p=. $V_{out} = $  $(R_2/(R_1 + R_2))  V_S$

Throughout the book we will often use extended '_observation wires_' connected to some nodes (as in "Figure 5.3":#figure5-3) to indicate more clearly a voltage of interest in a circuit.  Even with such extended wires these wires DO NOT form any added loop nor any added node, and hence the circuit response is exactly the same as that without the 'observation wires'.  They only make a specific voltage more recognizable, they do not change the circuit in any way.

** _5.1.2  Voltage Divider Application, Light Detector Examples_

The voltage divider circuit provides a very elegant means to measure light, when the circuit employs a photo-sensitive resistor as one of two in-series resistors.  But first, what is a _photo-sensitive resistor_?  It is a two terminal element that exhibits the same electrical characteristic as a usual fixed resistor, such as in Section 2.4.  However, the photo-sensitive resistor has the internal material exposed to the outside world, and the internal material changes electrical properties when exposed to light !

So the photo-sensitive resistor is a resistor-type circuit element represented here by the symbol in "Figure 5.4":#figure5-4.

p=(#figure5-4). !{width:40%}img/5/circuitsF5.4.jpg(Figure 5.4)!:img/5/circuitsF5.4.jpg
_Figure 5.4  Photosensitive Resistor_

The key difference for this element is that the resistance value, $R_{ph}$, changes with the intensity of light that shines on the element.  Thus the formula for the constraint, "Eq'n. 5.3":#eq5-3 is the same as "Eq'n. 2.4":#eq2-4, except the value of resistor $R_{ph}$ changes with the amount of incident light.

p=(#eq5-3). $(v_{n1} - v_{n2}) - i_R R_{ph} = 0$  Eq'n 5.3

Usually the photo-resistance value, $R_{ph}$, decreases as the light intensity increases.  For example, if the light intensity is normalized to full sun light, $S = 1$, (suns), then $R_{ph}$ would be of the form:

p=(eq5-4). $(R_{ph} / S)$  - ohms Eq'n 5.4

For this relation, as the light intensity *decreases*, $S$ gets smaller and $R_{ph}$ *gets larger*.  So for indoor conditions, if $S = 0.01$ then the value of $R_{ph}$ increases to 10,000 ohms.

*** _5.1.2 (i)  Photo-sensor at 'bottom' position of voltage divider_

Now if we place this photo-sensitive resistor at the 'bottom leg' of a voltage divider circuit, "Figure 5.5":#figure5-5, we can produce a voltage, $v_{out}$, (taken across the photo-resistor) that changes according to the amount of light.

p=(#figure5-5). !{width:40%}img/5/circuitsF5.5.jpg(Figure 5.5)!:img/5/circuitsF5.5.jpg
_Figure 5.5  Photo-Sensitive Circuit, Detects Light Intensity_

To find out the light response, we first recognize this circuit as a single-loop circuit series connection restriction. Thus, we can apply the _voltage divider_ "Eq'n. 5.2":#eq5-2 to this single loop structure, and thereby directly write the output response equation of "Eq'n. 5.5":#eq5-5.  Here the photo-resistor value decreases as the light intensity increases, and hence the voltage at the output, $v_{out}$, also decreases as light intensity increases.  Thus, as calculated below the circuit of Figure 5.5 yields an _output voltage that decreases as the light increases_, an inverse relationship.

p=(#eq5-5). $V_{out} = $  $(R_{ph}/(R_m + R_{ph}))  V_S$  Eq'n 5.5

By substitution, using "Eq'n. 5.4":#eq5-4 in "Eq'n. 5.5":#eq5-5, and when $SR_m >> 100$, (i.e. at brighter light levels, larger $S$) we get an output voltage, which is inversely related to the light strength $S$, given the fixed voltage source, $V_S$, is a constant.

p=. $V_{out} = $  $(100/S)/(R_m + 100/S)  V_S = (100/S R_m) V_S$


*** _5.1.2 (ii)  ) Photo-sensor at 'top' position of voltage divider_

Alternately we might want an output voltage, $V_{out}$, that is more directly related to light level, that is, we desire an output voltage that _increases_ as the light level, $S$, *increases*, a direct relationship.  To obtain this result we 'reverse' the positions of the two resistors.  Namely we place the photo-sensitive resistor, $R_{ph}$, at the 'top' position of the divider, and the fixed $R_m$ at the 'bottom' output side of the divider circuit.

With the resistor positions reversed, there is still a single-loop circuit and the voltage divider is now that depicted in "Figure 5.6":#figure5-6.

p=(#figure5-6). !{width:40%}img/5/circuitsF5.6.jpg(Figure 5.6)!:img/5/circuitsF5.6.jpg
_Figure 5.6  Alternate Photo-Sensitive Circuit, Detect Light Intensity_

We can apply the voltage divider equation, and now get the output response of "Eq'n. 5.6":#eq5-6.  So in this case the voltage at the output, $v_{out}$, increases as the photo-resistor value decreases, and correspondingly when the light intensity increases.  Thus the circuit of Figure 5.6":#figure5-6 yields an _output voltage that increases as the light increases_.

p=(#eq5-6). $V_{out} = (R_m/(R_m + R_{ph})) V_S$  Eq'n 5.6

and, by substitution of "Eq'n. 5.4":#eq5-4 for the photo-sensitive resistor we obtain:

p=. $V_{out} = $  $(R_m)/(R_m + 100/S)  V_S = (S R_m/100) V_S$

So the output voltage is about proportional to the light level, $S$, provided we keep the light level small, $S R_m << 100$.

Already with a simple single-loop circuit we can create a light-sensitive voltage and thus make a light detection circuit.  Furthermore, with a minor change of only the circuit position of the resistors we can change the voltage response from either increasing or decreasing as the light intensity increases.  By simple application of our constraint based analysis methods we can get distinct expressions for the actual expected voltage response.

Note that our analysis in this case has taken a simplified solution approach, the last "Eq'ns 5.5":#eq5-5: and "Eq'n. 5.6":#eq5-6 and were found, not by complete constraint analysis, but rather by recognition that the problem circuit was the specialized configuration of the voltage divider.  We therefore could apply the voltage divider result and did not have to calculate a solution from the element constraint equations.  The recognition of the voltage divider configuration is a convenient and often used short-cut to a circuit solution.

The second special circuit topology is one where all elements are connected between the _same 2 nodes_. "Figure 5.7":#figure5-7 depicts an example of a 2-node (single node-pair) circuit.
