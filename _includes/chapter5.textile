In this section we apply our knowledge of constraints for elements (the constitutive relations), and the constraints for circuits (KCL and KVL) to examine two major circuit topologies that appear repeatedly in many practical circuits.  By circuit topology we refer to a specific arrangement of circuit elements.  The two arrangements here involve specific _restrictions_, ones that simplify our work and enable a very rapid evaluation once the configuration is correctly recognized.  It is also true that incorrect assessment of the configuration will result in an incorrect result, so it is really important to understand the two specific types of restrictions that we consider in this section.


h4(#chapter5-series-restriction). 5.1 - Series Connection: Single-Loop Restriction


Consider the first special topology the _single loop_ circuit structure, see "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a.  Here we mean that all elements of the circuit are connected so they form a single loop.  Because the circuit is a single loop, and because of our KCL current law, there can be only one current in all elements in the loop.  "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a depicts this arrangement, called a series connection.

In the series circuit, "Figure 5.1a":#figure5-1a, all 4 elements are connected end-to-end to form a _single loop_.  There is a single current, '$i$', in the circuit.  This current, '$i$', passes _equally_ through resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$, and fixed voltage source $V_S$.  There is no other path for curent in this current, so KCL requires current, $i$, must be of _*equal* value in all 4 elements_.

However, if we now add another element so that there is NOT a single loop, but instead two (or more) loops, see "Figure 5.1b":#figure5-1b; then due to KCL at node n2, the current '$i_1$' is NOT the same in all 5 elements.  The added resistor $R_4$ in "Figure 5.1b":#figure5-1b causes the current '$i_1$' to split so a portion, '$i_2$', continues on to go through $R_2$ and $R_3$; and a portion, '$i_4$', branches through $R_4$.  In Figure 5.1b, it is no longer true that the same current '$i_1$' passes through all elements.  This non-equal current is the direct consequence of there being _more than a single loop_.  That $i_2$ cannot not equal $i_1$ in Figure 5.1b, is proved by KCL at node n2:

p=. $-i_1 + i_2 + i_4 = 0$

Since $i_4$ is not zero, this means the current, $i_2$, in resistors $R_2$ and $R_3$ cannot equal that in resistor $R_1$.

So the single-loop circuit restriction causes a special result, all currents must be equal.  A _'series connection'_ of elements thus simply means those elements in series are connected such that they all have the _same current.  If the elements do not have the same current, those elements cannot be in 'series'_.

** _A Single Loop Circuit Example: the Voltage Divider_

Lets consider a circuit with 3 elements as depicted in "Figure 5.2":#figure5-2.  This circuit has a single loop with a fixed voltage source and 2 resistors.  Because the 2 resistors are in the same loop we will know they must have the same current, I = iR1 = iR2, and are in series.

Now we employ our node-method of circuit solution to solve this circuit.

*STEP-1:*

In this circuit we have already selected the reference node (n3) and set the voltage of it to zero.  This is indicated by the 'ground' symbol at node n3, which means the node is connected to zero volts, $v_{n3} = 0$.  All currents and node voltages have also been labeled.

*STEP-2:*

We write the conservation law constraints, KCL, and directly apply the resistor constitutive constraints to express the current values.

p=. At node n2: $-i_{R1} + i_{R2} = 0$
And by substitution:

p=. $(-(v_{n1} - v{n2})/R_1) + ((v_{n2} - 0)/R_2) = 0$

additionally, because of the constraint by the fixed voltage source at node n1 to node n3:

p=. $(v_{n1} - 0) - V_S = 0$,   so

p=. $v_{n1} = v_{S}$
divide by R1: 

p=. $(v_{n1}/R_1) = (V_S/R_1)$
and substitute:

p=. $v_{n2}((1/R_1) + (1/R_2)) = V_S/R_1$
so finally:

p=. $v_{n2} = (R_2/(R_1 + R_2))V_S$

This result reveals that while the voltage at node n1 is the source voltage, $V_S$, the voltage at node n2, $v_{n2}, is a _constant fraction_ of the fixed source voltage $V_S$.  The fraction value is determined only by the resistor resistance values $R_1$ and $R_2$.

This fixed fraction single-loop circuit, is often termed a _*voltage divider*_, and is a very common circuit.  It is a single loop circuit with _two resistors connected in *series*_.  Lets clearly identify the voltage divider configuration.  Both circuits in "Figure 5.3":#figure5-3 are the same voltage divider configuration, just arranged differently, and both circuits yield exactly the same outcome.  There is _one loop_ in each and hence there is a single current, $i$, that passes through all three circuit elements.

Furthermore, here in order to emphasis the voltage of interest, the '_output voltage_, $V_{out}$, these figures explicitly show the connection across resistor $R_2$ exaggerated.  Two '_open observation wires_' contact each node at the ends of resistor $R_2$.  BUT because these wire extensions DO NOT FORM A LOOP, _they carry zero current_ and do not change the voltage across $R_2$ !!  Thus $V_{out}$ is exactly the same as the voltage across $R_2$, $v_{n2}$.

p=. $V_{out} = (R_2/(R_1_ + R_2)) V_S$

Throughout the book we will often use extended '_observation wires_' connected to some nodes (as in "Figure 5.3":#figure5-3) to indicate more clearly a voltage of interest in a circuit.  Even with such extended wires these wires DO NOT form any added loop nor any added node, and hence the circuit response is exactly the same as that without the 'observation wires'.  They only make a specific voltage more recognizable, they do not change the circuit in any way.
