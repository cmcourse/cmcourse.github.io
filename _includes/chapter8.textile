There are a number of very practical and interesting circuits that make use of resistors.  In this Section we will examine several resistor circuits that are often found in practical electronic systems.  These include signal attenuators, binary ladders and bridge circuits.  They employ only resistors yet are found in one form or another at the work-bench of essentially every circuit designer/developer.

h4(#chapter8-signal-attenuator). 8.1 - Signal Attenuators

While we are already familiar with the classic voltage divider, we will see that the '_attenuator_' circuit is a special kind of voltage divider.  The attenuator is a circuit, which when added into a signal path _always reduces_ the signal magnitude by a fixed known amount, for example by a factor of 2x or 10x (ie. to 1/2 or 1/10th of the original size).  But first we examine why the usual voltage divider is not this circuit.

Recall the voltage divider circuit is comprised of two resistors connected in series (single loop).  Two examples are depicted in "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1, divide by 2 and divide by 10.

p=(#figure8-1). !{width:65%}img/8/circuitsF8.1.jpg(Figure 8.1)!:img/8/circuitsF8.1.jpg
signal reduced by 1/2 ................................ signal reduced by 1/10
_Figure 8.1  Voltage Dividers of 1/2 and 1/10_

A very important _constraint_ for all such classical voltage divider circuits is that there is no current taken at the output terminals, v2 or v4.  _This constraint is because the calculations assume two series connected resistors and hence nothing can be connected at the output terminals._  For example "Figure 8.2":#figure8-2 depicts the connection of a 10k resistor at the output of the 1/2 voltage divider, but with the added resistance across v2, *now the output IS NO LONGER 1/2 the input*, rather (by resistor equivalent reduction) the divider ratio is 1/3rd.

p=(#figure8-2). !{width:40%}img/8/circuitsF8.2.jpg(Figure 8.2)!:img/8/circuitsF8.2.jpg
_Figure 8.2  Voltage Divider with Added Resistor, Changes the First Divider Ratio to 1/3rd_

Furthermore, if the two divider circuits of "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1 are connected in cascade, the first no longer exhibits the original divider ratio (of 1/2) because the connection destroys the constraint that the divider be a series circuit of two resistors, "Figure 8.3":#figure8-3.  The first divider ratio is changed to 1/3rd .

p=(#figure8-3). !{width:60%}img/8/circuitsF8.3.jpg(Figure 8.3)!:img/8/circuitsF8.3.jpg
_Figure 8.3  Cascade of Voltage Dividers Alters Individual Divider Ratio_

** 8.1.1  The Matched Attenuator Concept

A different approach to signal size reduction is the 'matched attenuator'.  The matched attenuator involves an added constraint to our circuit design.  This added constraint is that the attenuator circuit will be connected to a 'matched' circuit.  Recall the idea for maximum power is to have the load resistance equal (match) to the source resistance, as seen in "Figure 8.4":#figure8-4.

p=(#figure8-4). !{width:40%}img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg(Figure 8.4)!:img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg
_Figure 8.4   Load Resistance 'Matched' to Equal Source Resistance_

Now with the concept of a matched attenuator, "Figure 8.5":#figure8-5, this attenuator can be inserted between the source and load and then acts to reduce the output voltage at the load by the fixed known amount of 1/k.  Here "k" is a design value constant; for example with k = 5, the output voltage $v_O$ would then be 1/5 the input voltage, $v_i$.

p=(#figure8-5). !{width:63%}img/8/circuitsF8.5.jpg(Figure 8.5)!:img/8/circuitsF8.5.jpg
_Figure 8.5   Attenuator Added Between Source and Load_


** 8.1.2  The Signal Attenuator 'TEE' Circuit

To accomplish this desired goal of a fix attenuation with a connected matched load, a symmetric “TEE” resistor circuit is used.  This is depicted in "Figure 8.6":#figure8-6.

p=(#figure8-6). !{width:62%}img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg(Figure 8.6)!:img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg
_Figure 8.6   Symmetric_ "TEE" _Attenuator Circuit of Resistors_

Notice there are two constraints: (1) to keep a 'matched' system, the equivalent resistance 'seen' by the source looking into the attenuator, $R_{eq-in}$, must be the value of matched resistance $R_S$.  And (2) the attenuation factor "k" is specified, where by definition:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>


** 8.1.3  The Signal Attenuator 'Tee' Circuit Analysis

Now lets apply these constraints, for $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_S$, we have:

p=. $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_1$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_S)R_2}{R_1 + R_S + R_2}$ = $R_S$

and for attenuation factor of "k", by equivalent resistance and voltage divider: requires:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $(\frac{\frac{(R_1+R_S)R_2}{R_1+R_S+R_2}}{R_1+(\frac{(R_1+R_S)R_2}{R_1+R_S+R_2})})$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>

These are two equations for $R_1$, $R_2$, $k$, and $R_S$.  But the matched resistance, $R_S$, and $k$ are known, so we solve for $R_1$:

p=. $R_1$ = $R_S$ $\frac{(k-1)}{(k+1)}$

and we have for $R_2$:

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{R_1 + R_S}{(k-1)}$ = $\frac{2kR_S}{(k^2-1)}$

As an example, consider the case where $R_S$ = 100 ohms, and _k_ = 2.  Then we get calculated values of:

p=. $R_1$ = 100$\frac{(2-1)}{(2+1)}$ = 33.3 ohm

and

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{(33.3 + 100)}{(2-1)}$ = 133.3 ohm

The resultant attenuator circuit is depicted in "Figure 8.7":#figure8-7.

p=(#figure8-7). !{width:60%}img/8/circuitsF8.7.jpg(Figure 8.7)!:img/8/circuitsF8.7.jpg
_Figure 8.7   Attenuator with "k" attenuation factor = 2, and $R_S$ = 100 ohm_

h4(#chapter8-ladder-networks). 8.2 - Ladder Networks

A ladder network is composed of a series of repeated sets of resistors.  "Figure 8.8a":#figure8-8a , 8b, and 8c illustrate such ladder networks, with 1, 2 and 3-stages respectively.


table(#figure8-8).
|=. !{width:65%}img/8/circuitsF8.8a.jpg(Figure 8.8a)!:img/8/circuitsF8.8a.jpg |=. !{width:70%}img/8/circuitsF8.8b.jpg(Figure 8.8a)!:img/8/circuitsF8.8b.jpg |

|\2=. !{width:57%}img/8/circuitsF8.8c.jpg(Figure 8.8)!:img/8/circuitsF8.8c.jpg |
|\2=. _Figure 8.8  Ladder Binary Divider_ |


These particular ladder networks (with 'vertical' resistors of 2x the 'horizontal' resistors, except the last is 1x) produce a sequence of voltages that progressively get smaller.  Each additional stage acts to reduce the source voltage by a factor of 2.  Hence for the xth stage the voltage becomes, Eq'n 8.3:

<h4>
p=. $V_{nx}$ = $\frac{V_S}{2^X}$ </h4>

We can extend the resistive ladder idea to one that is infinitely long, "Figure 8.9":#figure8-9.  Furthermore, we ask what is the equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, at the terminal pair A-A' at the beginning of the infinitely long ladder.

p=(#figure8-9). !{width:67%}img/8/circuitsF8.9.jpg(Figure 8.9)!:img/8/circuitsF8.9.jpg
_Figure 8.9   Infinite Ladder_

This structure is one that illustrates the concept of recursion.  If at A-A' there is an equivalent resistance, Req, then there must be the same value of $R_{eq}$ looking to the right at terminals B-B', "Figure 8.10":#figure8-10.  Why?  Adding or subtracting one resistor pair to an infinite series does not change the result, since in both cases there is the same infinite ladder of resistors in the same arrangement.

p=(#figure8-10). !{width:70%}img/8/circuitsF8.10.jpg(Figure 8.10)!:img/8/circuitsF8.10.jpg
_Figure 8.10   Separation of Single 'Stage' of Infinite Ladder_

The infinite ladder circuit can now be represented by an equivalent circuit, which contains just 3 resistors, "Figure 8.11":#figure8-11.  Here the unknown value of $R_{eq}$ is used to calculate the value of $R_{eq}$.

p=(#figure8-11). !{width:45%}img/8/circuitsF8.11.jpg(Figure 8.11)!:img/8/circuitsF8.11.jpg
_Figure 8.11   Recursive Equivalent Circuit for Infinite Ladder_

Solving this by parallel and series equivalent resistances, yields:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $R_1$ + $\frac{R_2 R_{eq}}{R_2 + R_{eq}}$

and expanding:

p=. $R_{eq}(R_2 + R_{eq})$ = $R_1(R_2 + R_{eq}) + R_2R_{eq}$

collecting terms

p=. $R_{eq}^2 - R_1R_{eq} + R_1R_2$ = 0

and thus Eq'n 8.4:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1 ±(R_1^2 + 4R_1R_2)^{1/2}}{2}$

Where only a positive value is accepted.  Notice that if $R_2$ = $2R_1$, then $R_{eq}$ becomes:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1 ±(R_1^2 + 8R_1^2)^{1/2}}{2}$

and thus

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $2R_1$

A simple answer to an infinite string of resistors, obtained by 'recursion'.

h4(#chapter8-mesh-networks). 8.3 - Symmetric Mesh Networks

Another form of resistive circuit employs structures that are physically symmetric around some 'axis' and form a mesh. "Figure 8.12":#figure8-12 depicts a single mesh.

p=(#figure8-12). !{width:30%}img/8/circuitsF8.12.jpg(Figure 8.12)!:img/8/circuitsF8.12.jpg
_Figure 8.12   Symmetric Single Mesh Resistor_

This circuit can be reduced by the method of equivalents.  Firstly, there are two pairs of two 3k resistors each in series.  Hence the circuit reduces to two 6k resistors in parallel.  And these reduce to 1 single equivalent resistor between terminals A-A' of $3 k$.  This reduction is depicted in "Figure 8.13":#figure8-13.

p=(#figure8-13). !{width:70%}img/8/circuitsF8.13.jpg(Figure 8.13)!:img/8/circuitsF8.13.jpg
_Figure 8.13   Reduction of Single Mesh to an Equivalent Resistor_

Now consider a 4-mesh symmetric circuit, depicted in "Figure 8.14":#figure8-14.  There are 12 resistors, each of value R ohms.

p=(#figure8-14). !{width:50%}img/8/circuitsF8.14.jpg(Figure 8.14)!:img/8/circuitsF8.14.jpg
_Figure 8.14   Symmetric 4-Mesh Circuit of 12 Resistors of R ohms Each_

The quickest way to solve this circuit is to realize that it is symmetric about the diagonal dashed line.  There are 6 resistors to the right-side of the diagonal and symmetrically there are 6 resistors to the left-side of the diagonal.  Because of symmetry there is no current that goes from the left-side to the right-side, and hence we can make an equivalent circuit for each side separately.  The ride-side equivalent is seen in "Figure 8.15":#figure8-15.

p=(#figure8-15). !{width:45%}img/8/circuitsF8.15.jpg(Figure 8.15)!:img/8/circuitsF8.15.jpg
_Figure 8.15   Right-Side Only Equivalent Circuit_

This can be further reduced to 3 resistors of $R$ ohms each connected in series, which yields a final equivalent resistance for the right-side of $3R$ ohms.

The left-side equivalent resistance is calculated in just the same way and is also $3R$ ohms.  When combined the two sides (left and right) are in parallel, and hence the final total equivalent resistance, Req, between the terminals B-B' is $3/2 R$.

p=. $R_{B-B'}$ = $\frac{3}{2}R$

h4(#chapter8-delta-wye). 8.4 - Transformations, 'Delta-Wye'  ($\Delta$-Y); Bridge Circuits

There are some circuits that we would like to understand, but include neither a series connection nor a parallel connection.  Such circuits seem not possible to reduce.  However, there is a technique, called _transformation_, which enables our reduction methods to be applied.  One common transformation is the 'delta-wye'.  It allows us to replace a group of resistors with a different group of resistors.  ESSENTIAL to the replacement is that the two _groups_ yield identical equivalent resistance values _as seen at the terminals of the group_.

Consider the circuit in "Figure 8.16":#figure8-16.  It is called a 'bridge' circuit.  This circuit contains 5 resistors, where resistor $R_3$ 'bridges' (connects) between the two sides of $R_1$ & $R_4$ and $R_2$ & $R_5$.  Note that there are no two resistors either in series or in parallel.  Hence it appears this circuit cannot be reduced to an equivalent single resistance, $R_{eq}$, at least not by simple series-parallel reductions.

p=(#figure8-16). !{width:40%}img/8/circuitsF8.16.jpg(Figure 8.16)!:img/8/circuitsF8.16.jpg
_Figure 8.16   General Bridge Circuit_

For emphasis, this Figure identifies 4 nodes; A, B, C, and D.  Now lets make a sub-section of this circuit that only contains the 3-nodes A, B, and C, and also only the three resistors that connect to those nodes, $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$.  We redraw this three-resistor circuit, as shown in "Figure 8.17":#figure8-17, with the exact same 3-nodes and the same 3 individual resistors.  This arrangement forms a 'delta' configuration.

p=(#figure8-17). !{width:28%}img/8/circuitsF8.17.jpg(Figure 8.17)!:img/8/circuitsF8.17.jpg
_Figure 8.17   3-Node 'Delta' Connection of 3 Resistors_

Now we consider, this circuit has three nodes, and if we look at the equivalent resistance between any 2 of these nodes we can calculate an equivalent resistance value.  For example between nodes A and B, the equivalent resistance is $R_1$ in parallel with the series combination of $(R_2 + R_3)$ [Provided node C is an open circuit at the time of this measurement.].

p=. $R_{AB-open C}$ = $R_1$ || $(R_2 + R_3)$

Similarly we could look at the nodes A and C and find the equivalent resistance of $R_2$ in parallel with the series combination of $(R_1 + R_3)$ [provided node B is an open circuit].  A similar value of $R_3$ in parallel with the series $(R_1+R_2)$ value occurs for the node-pair B and C [with node A an open circuit].  Thus, we see there is an equivalent resistance that can be evaluated between each of the node pairs, A-B, A-C and B-C.

p=. $R_{AC-open B}$ = $R_2$ || $(R_1 + R_3)$
$R_{BC-open A}$ = $R_3$ || $(R_1 + R_2)$

Now consider _another_ circuit with the same 3 node-pairs, but a _different arrangement of different resistors_.  If this different arrangement yielded the identical equivalent resistance between the 3 nodes, then from the outside the two circuits would yield identical results.  The other circuit to consider is depicted in "Figure 8.18":#figure8-18.  It is in the shape of a "Y", and hence the transformation is called a 'delta-wye' transform.

p=(#figure8-18). !{width:65%}img/8/circuitsF8.18.jpg(Figure 8.18)!:img/8/circuitsF8.18.jpg
_Figure 8.18   Delta and Wye Equivalent Circuits_

By proper calculation for the values of $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$ these two circuits will look identical as seen from the same 3 nodes A, B, and C.  It is true that the 'Y' shape circuit has an extra 4th node, but it is internal to the circuit.  But that internal node is NOT connected to the outside of the circuit, so it is not 'accessible'.  Hence we need only make the equivalent resistances apply to nodes A, B, and C.  Thus, we calculate the equivalent resistances between nodes A-B as $R_{AB}$, between nodes A-C as $R_{AC}$ and between nodes B-C as $R_{BC}$.  We then equate the three equivalent resistances for the two circuits and solve for the relationships between resistors.

p=. $R_{AB-open C}$ = $R_1$ || $(R_2 + R_3)$ = $R_A$ + $R_B$
$R_{AC-open B}$ = $R_2$ || $(R_1 + R_3)$ = $R_A$ + $R_C$
$R_{BC-open A}$ = $R_3$ || $(R_1 + R_2)$ = $R_B$ + $R_C$

Solving these three equations for $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$, yields, Eq'n 8-5:

<h4>
p=. $R_A$ = $\frac{R_1R_2}{(R_1 + R_2 + R_3)}$, .... $R_B$ = $\frac{R_1R_3}{(R_1 + R_2 + R_3)}$, and .... $R_C$ = $\frac{R_2R_3}{(R_1 + R_2 + R_3)}$ </h4>
_Eq'n 8-5  Transformation from 'Delta' to 'Wye' Representations_

Alternately, _if starting from the 'Y' configuration_, then the 'delta' resistor values can be calculated from:

<h4>
p=. $R_1$ = $\frac{(R_A R_B) + (R_B R_C) + (R_A R_C)}{R_C}$
$R_2$ = $\frac{(R_A R_B) + (R_B R_C) + (R_A R_C)}{R_B}$
$R_3$ = $\frac{(R_A R_B) + (R_B R_C) + (R_A R_C)}{R_A}$ </h4>
_Eq'n 8-6:  Transformation from 'Wye' to the 'Delta'; Representations_

Now lets apply our 'delta-wye' transformation to the original 'bridge' problem.  The upper portion of the bridge is a 'delta', and hence we can replace it with the corresponding 'wye' configuration, with the correct resistor values for $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$, as follows.  The bridge circuit of "Figure 8.16":#figure8-16, becomes the circuit in "Figure 8.19":#figure8-19.

p=(#figure8-19). !{width:45%}img/8/circuitsF8.19.jpg(Figure 8.19)!:img/8/circuitsF8.19.jpg
_Figure 8.19   Modified Bridge Circuit, After Delta-Wye Transformation_

Where, the values of $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$ are those in Eq'n 8-5.  Now we have two sets of two resistors in series, so the circuit can be reduced to "Figure 8.20":#figure8-20:

p=(#figure8-20). !{width:50%}img/8/circuitsF8.20.jpg(Figure 8.20)!:img/8/circuitsF8.20.jpg
_Figure 8.20   Reduced Bridge Circuit_

Hence by parallel and series reductions, we arrive at the final value for the total equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$.

<h4>
p=. $R_{eq}$ = $R_A$ + $\frac{(R_B + R_4)(R_C + R_5)}{(R_B + R_4) + (R_C + R_5)}$ </h4>

The delta-wye transformation is an important 'tool', especially when bridge circuits are part of a circuit of interest.  While they take some math, this transformation enables us to understand how each of the different resistors contributes to the total effective resistance.  In this case, $R_A$ is a distinct additive term to the equivalent resistance.  And we know that $R_A$ is the simple product of $R_1$ and $R_2$, divided by the sum of $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$.  So here the product of two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ can have a significant impact on the final $R_{eq}$.

** _8.4.1 'Near Open' Bridge Circuit, $R_3$ Large_

Now lets further restrict the bridge circuit of "Figure 8.16":#figure8-16 to the condition where the resistor that 'bridges' the two sides, namely $R_3$, is constrained to be of relatively high value compared to $R_1$ and $R_2$, meaning there is only a relatively small current in $R_3$. Hence we restrict:

p=. $R_3$ >> $R_1$, or $R_2$

Thus with a large value $R_3$ we can simplify our equivalent resistance values as follows:

p=. $R_B + R_4$ = $\frac{(R_1R_3)}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)} + R_4$ $\cong$ $R_1 + R_4$

and

p=. $R_C + R_5$ = $\frac{(R_2R_3)}{(R_1+R_2+R_3)} + R_5$ $\cong$ $R_2 + R_5$ 

and

p=. $R_A$ = $\frac{R_1R_2}{(R_1 + R_2 + R_3)}$ $\cong$ $\frac{R_1R_2}{R_3}$

The total $R_{eq}$, under the constraint of a high value for $R_3$ thus becomes approximately:

p=. $R_{eq}$ $\cong$ $\frac{R_1R_2}{R_3}$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_4)(R_2 + R_5)}{(R_1 + R_4) + (R_2 + R_5)}$

This high value $R_3$ restriction corresponds to a 'small current' in $R_3$, and can occur in practice when the $R_3$ resistor might be a high effective input resistance of a measurement meter set to measure the voltage between the two bridge nodes 'B' and 'C' in "Figure 8.16":#figure8-16.

** _8.4.2 'At Balance' Bridge Circuit_

Lets now consider another constraint to our bridge circuit.  Here we further constrain our bridge circuit and select specific values, which are called a 'balanced bridge'.  First, we _assume there is no current_ in $R_3$, and thus remove it.  This is depicted in "Figure 8.21":#figure8-21, where there is also an added voltage source, $V_S$, across the bridge to better illustrate the 'balance' condition.

p=(#figure8-21). !{width:40%}img/8/circuitsF8.21.jpg(Figure 8.21)!:img/8/circuitsF8.21.jpg
_Figure 8.21   Bridge Circuit with Voltage Source_

Secondly, we restrict the remaining four resistor values so the bridge nodes 'B' and 'C' are at the same voltage, in other words the difference voltage, $V_{BC}$ = 0. This is the 'balanced' condition, where there is no current between 'B' and 'C' and requires the two voltage dividers, on the 'left' and 'right' sides, must yield the same ratio, so:

p=. $V_B$ = ($\frac{R_4}{R_1 + R_4})V_S$ and $V_C$ = ($\frac{R_5}{R_2 + R_5})V_S$

reducing:

p=. ($\frac{R_4}{R_1 + R_4}$) = ($\frac{R_5}{R_2 + R_5}$)

and, thus at balance:

p=. $R_4(R_2+R_5)$ = $R_5(R_1+R_4)$

and, since the product ($R_4R_5$) on both sides cancels, we get balance when:

p=. $R_4(R_2)$ = $R_5(R_1)$

Or solving for R_5, *bridge circuit balance* occurs when:

p=. $R_5$ = $(\frac{R_2}{R_1})R_4$

So _at bridge balance_ when $R_4$ is adjusted so $V_{BC}$ = 0, then $R_5$ is equal to $R_4$ scaled by the ratio $R_2$ / $R_1$.  Note, it is the ratio value of ($R_2$ / $R_1$) that needs to be known, not the individual values of $R_2$ and $R_1$ in this balance.  If we know the $R_2/R_1$ ratio and adjust R4 to get 'balance', then we can measure the resistor $R_5$ value from the balance value of known $R_4$.

With this 'balanced' condition for the bridge circuit, we can again ask what is the effective equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, as seen at the terminals 'A' - 'D', see "Figure 8.22":#figure8-22.

p=(#figure8-22). !{width:42%}img/8/circuitsF8.22.jpg(Figure 8.22)!:img/8/circuitsF8.22.jpg
_Figure 8.22   Balanced Bridge Equivalent Resistance, Electrically Open 'B' to 'C'_

By substitution, we calculate with the parallel connection of two series resistors as:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{(R_1 + R_4)(R_2 + R_5)}{(R_1 + R_4) + (R_2 + R_5)}$

where,

p=. $\frac{(R_2+R_5)}{(R_1+R_4)}$ = $\frac{R_5}{R_4}$ = $\frac{R_2}{R_1}$

and simplifying:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{(R_1+R_4)R_2}{R_1+R_2}$ = $[\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}](\frac{R_1+R_4}{R_1})$

The equivalent resistance _*at balance*_ is just equal to the parallel combination of $R_1$ and $R_2$ increased by the divider ratio. 

** _8.4.3 'Near-Balance' Bridge Circuit_

Finally, lets consider the 'balance bridge' condition, but now also _allow a large (but finite) value for_ $R_3$, "Figure 8.23":#figure8-23.   In other words, we include a relatively small resistive current between 'B' and 'C'.

p=(#figure8-23). !{width:42%}img/8/circuitsF8.23.jpg(Figure 8.23)!:img/8/circuitsF8.23.jpg
_Figure 8.23   Balanced Bridge Equivalent Resistance, With Bridge Resistor $R_3$_

From the prior subsection (8.4.1) we calculated the equivalent resistance to be approximately:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1R_2}{R_3}$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_4)(R_2 + R_5)}{(R_1 + R_4) + (R_2 + R_5)}$

But if we now additionally require the circuit to be in the 'balance' condition, then the constraint of the above subsection (8.4.2) applies.  By substitution:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1R_2}{R_3}$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_4)(R_2 + (\frac{R_2}{R_1})R_4)}{(R_1 + R_4) + (R_2 + (\frac{R_2}{R_1})R_4))}$

and by simplification:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1R_2}{R_3}$ + $\frac{(R_1 R_2)}{(R_1+R_2)}(\frac{(R_1+R_4)}{R_1)}$

At balance, the equivalent resistance for our bridge circuit is just the scaled increased parallel resistance of $R_1$ and $R_2$ (as found before in subsection (8.4.2) without $R_3$) and with an added small correction term.  This added term with $R_3$ in the denominator tends toward zero as the cross resistance $R_3$ is increased to larger and larger values, consistent with Section 8.4.2.
