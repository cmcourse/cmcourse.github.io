There are a number of very practical and interesting circuits that make use of resistors.  In this Section we will examine several resistor circuits that are often found in practical electronic systems.  These include signal attenuators, binary ladders and bridge circuits.  They employ only resistors yet are found in one form or another at the work-bench of essentially every circuit designer/developer.

h4(#chapter8-signal-attenuator). 8.1 - Signal Attenuators

While we are already familiar with the classic voltage divider, we will see that the '_attenuator_' circuit is a special kind of voltage divider.  The attenuator is a circuit, which when added into a signal path _always reduces_ the signal magnitude by a fixed known amount, for example by a factor of 2x or 10x (ie. to 1/2 or 1/10th of the original size).  But first we examine why the usual voltage divider is not this circuit.

Recall the voltage divider circuit is comprised of two resistors connected in series (single loop).  Two examples are depicted in "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1, divide by 2 and divide by 10.

p=(#figure8-1). !{width:65%}img/8/circuitsF8.1.jpg(Figure 8.1)!:img/8/circuitsF8.1.jpg

_Figure 8.1  Voltage Dividers of 1/2 and 1/10_

A very important _constraint_ for all such classical voltage divider circuits is that there is no current taken at the output terminals, v2 or v4.  _This constraint is because the calculations assume two series connected resistors and hence nothing can be connected at the output terminals._  For example "Figure 8.2":#figure8-2 depicts the connection of a 10k resistor at the output of the 1/2 voltage divider, but with the added resistance across v2, *now the output IS NO LONGER 1/2 the input*, rather (by resistor equivalent reduction) the divider ratio is 1/3rd.

_Figure 8.2  Voltage Divider with Added Resistor, Changes the First Divider Ratio to 1/3rd_

Furthermore, if the two divider circuits of "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1 are connected in cascade, the first no longer exhibits the original divider ratio (of 1/2) because the connection destroys the constraint that the divider be a series circuit of two resistors, "Figure 8.3":#figure8-3.  The first divider ratio is changed to 1/3rd .

** 8.1.1  The Matched Attenuator Concept

A different approach to signal size reduction is the 'matched attenuator'.  The matched attenuator involves an added constraint to our circuit design.  This added constraint is that the attenuator circuit will be connected to a 'matched' circuit.  Recall the idea for maximum power is to have the load resistance equal (match) to the source resistance, as seen in "Figure 8.4":#figure8-4.

p=(#figure8-4). !{width:40%}img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg(Figure 8.4)!:img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg
_Figure 8.4   Load Resistance 'Matched' to Equal Source Resistance_

Now with the concept of a matched attenuator, "Figure 8.5":#figure8-5, this attenuator can be inserted between the source and load and then acts to reduce the output voltage at the load by the fixed known amount of 1/k.  Here "k" is a design value constant; for example with k = 5, the output voltage $v_O$ would then be 1/5 the input voltage, $v_i$.

p=(#figure8-5). !{width:63%}img/8/circuitsF8.5.jpg(Figure 8.5)!:img/8/circuitsF8.5.jpg
_Figure 8.5   Attenuator Added Between Source and Load_


** 8.1.2  The Signal Attenuator 'TEE' Circuit

To accomplish this desired goal of a fix attenuation with a connected matched load, a symmetric “TEE” resistor circuit is used.  This is depicted in "Figure 8.6":#figure8-6.

p=(#figure8-6). !{width:62%}img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg(Figure 8.6)!:img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg
_Figure 8.6   Symmetric_ "TEE" _Attenuator Circuit of Resistors_

Notice there are two constraints: (1) to keep a 'matched' system, the equivalent resistance 'seen' by the source looking into the attenuator, $R_{eq-in}$, must be the value of matched resistance $R_S$.  And (2) the attenuation factor "k" is specified, where by definition:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>


** 8.1.3  The Signal Attenuator 'Tee' Circuit Analysis

Now lets apply these constraints, for $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_S$, we have:

p=. $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_1$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_S)R_2}{R_1 + R_S + R_2}$ = $R_S$

and for attenuation factor of "k", by equivalent resistance and voltage divider: requires:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $(\frac{\frac{(R_1+R_S)R_2}{R_1+R_S+R_2}}{R_1+(\frac{(R_1+R_S)R_2}{R_1+R_S+R_2})})$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>

These are two equations for $R_1$, $R_2$, $k$, and $R_S$.  But the matched resistance, $R_S$, and $k$ are known, so we solve for $R_1$:

p=. $R_1$ = $R_S$ $\frac{(k-1)}{(k+1)}$

and we have for $R_2$:

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{R_1 + R_S}{(k-1)}$ = $\frac{2kR_S}{(k^2-1)}$

As an example, consider the case where $R_S$ = 100 ohms, and _k_ = 2.  Then we get calculated values of:

p=. $R_1$ = 100$\frac{(2-1)}{(2+1)}$ = 33.3 ohm

and

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{(33.3 + 100)}{(2-1)}$ = 133.3 ohm

The resultant attenuator circuit is depicted in "Figure 8.7":#figure8-7.

h4(#chapter8-ladder-networks). 8.2 - Ladder Networks

A ladder network is composed of a series of repeated sets of resistors.  "Figure 8.8a":#figure8-8a , 8b, and 8c illustrate such ladder networks, with 1, 2 and 3-stages respectively.


table(#figure8-8).

|\2=. _Figure 8.8  Ladder Binary Divider_ |


These particular ladder networks (with 'vertical' resistors of 2x the 'horizontal' resistors, except the last is 1x) produce a sequence of voltages that progressively get smaller.  Each additional stage acts to reduce the source voltage by a factor of 2.  Hence for the xth stage the voltage becomes, Eq'n 8.3:
<h4>
p=. $V_{nx}$ = $\frac{V_S}{2^X}$ </h4>

We can extend the resistive ladder idea to one that is infinitely long, "Figure 8.9":#figure8-9.  Furthermore, we ask what is the equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, at the terminal pair A-A' at the beginning of the infinitely long ladder.

p=(#figure8-9). !{width:67%}img/8/circuitsF8.9.jpg(Figure 8.9)!:img/8/circuitsF8.9.jpg
_Figure 8.9   Infinite Ladder_

This structure is one that illustrates the concept of recursion.  If at A-A' there is an equivalent resistance, Req, then there must be the same value of $R_{eq}$ looking to the right at terminals B-B', "Figure 8.10":#figure8-10.  Why?  Adding or subtracting one resistor pair to an infinite series does not change the result, since in both cases there is the same infinite ladder of resistors in the same arrangement.

p=(#figure8-10). !{width:70%}img/8/circuitsF8.10.jpg(Figure 8.10)!:img/8/circuitsF8.10.jpg
_Figure 8.10   Separation of Single 'Stage' of Infinite Ladder_

The infinite ladder circuit can now be represented by an equivalent circuit, which contains just 3 resistors, "Figure 8.11":#figure8-11.  Here the unknown value of $R_{eq}$ is used to calculate the value of $R_{eq}$.

p=(#figure8-11). !{width:45%}img/8/circuitsF8.11.jpg(Figure 8.11)!:img/8/circuitsF8.11.jpg
_Figure 8.11   Recursive Equivalent Circuit for Infinite Ladder_

Solving this by parallel and series equivalent resistances, yields:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $R_1$ + $\frac{R_2 R_{eq}}{R_2 + R_{eq}}$

and expanding:

p=. $R_{eq}(R_2 + R_{eq})$ = $R_1(R_2 + R_{eq}) + R_2R_{eq}$

collecting terms

p=. $R_{eq}^2 - R_1R_{eq} + R_1R_2$ = 0

and thus Eq'n 8.4:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1 ±(R_1^2 + 4R_1R_2)^{1/2}}{2}$

Where only a positive value is accepted.  Notice that if $R_2$ = $2R_1$, then $R_{eq}$ becomes:

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $\frac{R_1 ±(R_1^2 + 8R_1^2)^{1/2}{2}$

and thus

p=. $R_{eq}$ = $2R_1$

A simple answer to an infinite string of resistors, obtained by 'recursion'.

h4(#chapter8-mesh-networks). 8.3 - Symmetric Mesh Networks

Another form of resistive circuit employs structures that are physically symmetric around some 'axis' and form a mesh. "Figure 8.12":#figure8-12 depicts a single mesh.

p=(#figure8-12). !{width:30%}img/8/circuitsF8.12.jpg(Figure 8.12)!:img/8/circuitsF8.12.jpg
_Figure 8.12   Symmetric Single Mesh Resistor_

This circuit can be reduced by the method of equivalents.  Firstly, there are two pairs of two 3k resistors each in series.  Hence the circuit reduces to two 6k resistors in parallel.  And these reduce to 1 single equivalent resistor between terminals A-A' of $3 k$.  This reduction is depicted in "Figure 8.13":#figure8-13.

p=(#figure8-13). !{width:70%}img/8/circuitsF8.13.jpg(Figure 8.13)!:img/8/circuitsF8.13.jpg
_Figure 8.13   Reduction of Single Mesh to an Equivalent Resistor_

Now consider a 4-mesh symmetric circuit, depicted in "Figure 8.14":#figure8-14.  There are 12 resistors, each of value R ohms.

p=(#figure8-14). !{width:50%}img/8/circuitsF8.14.jpg(Figure 8.14)!:img/8/circuitsF8.14.jpg
_Figure 8.14   Symmetric 4-Mesh Circuit of 12 Resistors of R ohms Each_

The quickest way to solve this circuit is to realize that it is symmetric about the diagonal dashed line.  There are 6 resistors to the right-side of the diagonal and symmetrically there are 6 resistors to the left-side of the diagonal.  Because of symmetry there is no current that goes from the left-side to the right-side, and hence we can make an equivalent circuit for each side separately.  The ride-side equivalent is seen in "Figure 8.15":#figure8-15.

p=(#figure8-15). !{width:45%}img/8/circuitsF8.15.jpg(Figure 8.15)!:img/8/circuitsF8.15.jpg
_Figure 8.15   Right-Side Only Equivalent Circuit_

This can be further reduced to 3 resistors of $R$ ohms each connected in series, which yields a final equivalent resistance for the right-side of $3R$ ohms.

The left-side equivalent resistance is calculated in just the same way and is also $3R$ ohms.  When combined the two sides (left and right) are in parallel, and hence the final total equivalent resistance, Req, between the terminals B-B' is $3/2 R$.

p=. $R_{B-B'}$ = $\frac{3}{2}R$
