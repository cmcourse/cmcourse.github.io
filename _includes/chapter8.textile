There are a number of very practical and interesting circuits that make use of resistors.  In this Section we will examine several resistor circuits that are often found in practical electronic systems.  These include signal attenuators, binary ladders and bridge circuits.  They employ only resistors yet are found in one form or another at the work-bench of essentially every circuit designer/developer.

h4(#chapter8-signal-attenuator). 8.1 - Signal Attenuators

While we are already familiar with the classic voltage divider, we will see that the '_attenuator_' circuit is a special kind of voltage divider.  The attenuator is a circuit, which when added into a signal path _always reduces_ the signal magnitude by a fixed known amount, for example by a factor of 2x or 10x (ie. to 1/2 or 1/10th of the original size).  But first we examine why the usual voltage divider is not this circuit.

Recall the voltage divider circuit is comprised of two resistors connected in series (single loop).  Two examples are depicted in "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1, divide by 2 and divide by 10.

A very important _constraint_ for all such classical voltage divider circuits is that there is no current taken at the output terminals, v2 or v4.  _This constraint is because the calculations assume two series connected resistors and hence nothing can be connected at the output terminals._  For example "Figure 8.2":#figure8-2 depicts the connection of a 10k resistor at the output of the 1/2 voltage divider, but with the added resistance across v2, *now the output IS NO LONGER 1/2 the input*, rather (by resistor equivalent reduction) the divider ratio is 1/3rd.

Furthermore, if the two divider circuits of "Figure 8.1":#figure8-1 are connected in cascade, the first no longer exhibits the original divider ratio (of 1/2) because the connection destroys the constraint that the divider be a series circuit of two resistors, "Figure 8.3":#figure8-3.  The first divider ratio is changed to 1/3rd .

** 8.1.1  The Matched Attenuator Concept

A different approach to signal size reduction is the 'matched attenuator'.  The matched attenuator involves an added constraint to our circuit design.  This added constraint is that the attenuator circuit will be connected to a 'matched' circuit.  Recall the idea for maximum power is to have the load resistance equal (match) to the source resistance, as seen in "Figure 8.4":#figure8-4.

p=(#figure8-4). !{width:42%}img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg(Figure 8.4)!:img/8/circuitsF8.4.jpg
_Figure 8.4   Load Resistance 'Matched' to Equal Source Resistance_

Now with the concept of a matched attenuator, "Figure 8.5":#figure8-5, this attenuator can be inserted between the source and load and then acts to reduce the output voltage at the load by the fixed known amount of 1/k.  Here "k" is a design value constant; for example with k = 5, the output voltage $v_O$ would then be 1/5 the input voltage, $v_i$.

** 8.1.2  The Signal Attenuator 'TEE' Circuit

To accomplish this desired goal of a fix attenuation with a connected matched load, a symmetric “TEE” resistor circuit is used.  This is depicted in "Figure 8.6":#figure8-6.

p=(#figure8-6). !{width:62%}img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg(Figure 8.6)!:img/8/circuitsF8.6.jpg
_Figure 8.6   Symmetric_ "TEE" _Attenuator Circuit of Resistors_

Notice there are two constraints: (1) to keep a 'matched' system, the equivalent resistance 'seen' by the source looking into the attenuator, $R_{eq-in}$, must be the value of matched resistance $R_S$.  And (2) the attenuation factor "k" is specified, where by definition:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>


** 8.1.3  The Signal Attenuator 'Tee' Circuit Analysis

Now lets apply these constraints, for $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_S$, we have:

p=. $R_{eq-in}$ = $R_1$ + $\frac{(R_1 + R_S)R_2}{R_1 + R_S + R_2}$ = $R_S$

and for attenuation factor of "k", by equivalent resistance and voltage divider: requires:

<h4>
p=. $\frac{v_O}{v_i}$ = $(\frac{\frac{(R_1+R_S)R_2}{R_1+R_S+R_2}}{(R_1+((R_1+R_S)R_2))})$ = $\frac{1}{k}$ </h4>

These are two equations for $R_1$, $R_2$, _k_, and $R_S$.  But the matched resistance, $R_S$, and _k_ are known, so we solve for $R_1$:

p=. $R_1$ = $R_S$ $\frac{(k-1)}{(k+1)}$

and we have for $R_2$:

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{R_1 + R_S}{(k-1)}$ = $\frac{2kR_S}{(k^2-1)}$

As an example, consider the case where $R_S$ = 100 ohms, and _k_ = 2.  Then we get calculated values of:

p=. $R_1$ = 100$\frac{(2-1)}{(2+1)}$ = 33.3 ohm

and

p=. $R_2$ = $\frac{(33.3 + 100)}{(2-1)}$ = 133.3 ohm

The resultant attenuator circuit is depicted in "Figure 8.67":#figure8-7.
