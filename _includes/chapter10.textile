At this point we turn our attention toward a new class of circuit elements.  The new elements enable control activated by electric quantities of voltage and/or current.  These controllable elements open a vast array of new circuit outcome possibilities, such as amplifiers and controllers of many kinds.  Until now all our elements (including sources) were '_independent_', they simply had two terminals and caused a _fixed_ relation of voltage and/or current constraint at their 2 terminals.

h4(#chapter10-control-teminals). 10.1 - Circuit Elements with Control Terminals

We now consider new elements that have _two terminal-pairs_.  This new element is '_dependent_' meaning it has a _control port_ which acts to influence a separate output port.  This structure is illustrated in "Figure 10.1":#figure10-1.

p=(#figure10-1). !{width:60%}img/10/circuitsF10.1.jpg(Figure 10.1)!:img/10/circuitsF10.1.jpg
_Figure 10.1  'Dependent' Element Structure, a Control Input Side and an Output Side_

We consider two forms of dependent elements: the _dependent source_ and the _operational amplifier_.  With both forms we will identify the current and voltage values at each of the two ports.  For example, the control side terminal pair might be represented by a voltage $v_C$ across these terminals, or alternately by current $i_C$, that circulates in these terminals.  The output side terminals would use voltage $v_O$ and current $i_O$.  For such _dependent_ elements inherently the output i-v characteristic of $i_O$ - $v_O$ is altered or adjusted by the applied control side values of $v_C$ and/or $i_C$ at the control input.

We will see in this Section exactly how to introduce control in our electronic circuits. This is a major change from all our prior elements, but also greatly expands the opportunities to implement a wide range of new results.

In particular, dependent elements enable the chance for 'power gain'. This 'gain' occurs when an increase in power provided at the output terminals requires far less power to drive the control terminals.  For example, a small voltage change at an input could actuate control of a very high power motor in a car, train or ship.  Until now all resistive circuits dissipate power, for example the voltage divider, and so the output voltage was always less than the input.  With dependent elements we can actually increase the amount of voltage at the output compared to that supplied at the input.

h4(#chapter10-dependent-sources). 10.2 - Dependent Voltage and Dependent Current Sources

Dependent elements that are _dependent sources_ have output terminals that yield a set amount of voltage or current with a value that is controlled by the voltage or current at the input.  These ideal elements can therefore produce power or absorb power according to circuit connections at the output terminals.

A _dependent voltage source_ provides a defined voltage at its' output terminals.  In that sense it is the same as our prior element the fixed voltage source.  The difference here is the value of the voltage is not fixed, but rather _depends_ upon on the voltage or current at the control terminals.

In order to clearly identify that a source is a _dependent source and not a fixed source_, the dependent source has a different symbol, a *diamond shape*, "Figure 10.2":#figure10-2.  Additionally, we must identify the control for the source.  There are two types of control, a voltage control, and a current control.  Notice the voltage source value is some constant, here called $K_1$, times the control voltage for the VC-VS, and some constant, here called $K_2$, times the control current for the CC-VS.
 
p=(#figure10-2). !{width:90%}img/10/circuitsF10.2.jpg(Figure 10.2)!:img/10/circuitsF10.2.jpg

_Figure 10.2  Dependent Voltage Sources, VC-VS and CC-VS_

Typically the voltage control terminals are two nodes identified as being the control, $V_C$.  And alternately, the control current is identified as the current between some two nodes, $I_C$.  As with a fixed voltage source, the dependent voltage source DOES NOT constrain the output current, only the output voltage.

A _dependent current source_ is similar; there are voltage controlled and current controlled sources.  This is depicted in "Figure 10.3":#figure10-3.  Again these are _dependent_ sources and thus the diamond shape is used.  There are two types of control, a voltage control, and a current control.  The current source value is some constant, here called $K_3$, times the control voltage for the VC-CS, and some constant, here called $K_4$, times the control current for the CC-CS.
 
p=(#figure10-3). !{width:90%}img/10/circuitsF10.3.jpg(Figure 10.3)!:img/10/circuitsF10.3.jpg
(a) Voltage-Controlled-Current-Source ........................... (b)  Current-Controlled-Current-Source
_Figure 10.3  Dependent Current Sources, VC-CS and CC-CS_

The control is specified as being a voltage or current between two nodes, respectively.  These dependent current sources set the value of the current at the output terminals, but they DO NOT constrain the voltage at the output terminals.  This constraint is the same as with fixed current sources, the difference is the source value is set by the quantities at the control terminals.

** *10.2.1  Example: Dependent Voltage Source Circuit*

As an illustration of the voltage-controlled-voltage-source (VCVS) consider the following circuit, "Figure 10.4":#figure10-4.

p=(#figure10-4). !{width:70%}img/10/circuitsF10.4.jpg(Figure 10.4)!:img/10/circuitsF10.4.jpg
_Figure 10.4  Example Circuit with Dependent Voltage Source_

The output voltage is calculated as a voltage divider, which reduces the 5 $V_C$ voltage from the dependent voltage source.

p=. $V_{out}$ = $(\frac{4k}{6k}) 5$ $V_C$

However, the dependent voltage source has the control, $V_C$.  The control voltage value, $V_C$, is determined from a voltage-divider relation applied to the 7 volt fixed voltage source.

p=. $V_C$ = $(\frac{3k}{9k})$ 7

By substitution:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $(\frac{4}{6}) 5$ $[(\frac{1}{3})7]$ = $\frac{70}{9}$ _volts_

** *10.2.2  Example: Dependent Current Source Circuit*

As an illustration of the voltage-controlled-current-source (VCCS) consider the following circuit, "Figure 10.5":#figure10-5.  The output voltage is the voltage across the current source.  But this may seem odd, since the voltage on a current source is NOT constrained by the current source itself.  However, other parts of this circuit DO constrain the output voltage.

p=(#figure10-5). !{width:70%}img/10/circuitsF10.5.jpg(Figure 10.5)!:img/10/circuitsF10.5.jpg
_Figure 10.5  Example Circuit with Dependent Current Source_

Here that the output voltage must be the voltage across the 2k resistor relative to ground.  So by KCL and ohm's law, we can write the output voltage, $V_{out}$, as the current from the current source times the 2k resistance.  The negative sign comes from the direction of the current source relative to $V_{out}$.

p=. $V_{out}$ = -$(2k) (5 V_C)$

Now we calculate the control voltage $V_C$ from the voltage divider acting on the 1 volt fixed source, as:

p=. $V_C$ = $(\frac{1k}{2k}) 1$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ _volts_

Hence, the output voltage, $V_{out}$, is:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $(-2k) 5$ $[(\frac{1}{2})(mA)]$ = 5 _volts_

** *10.2.3  Example: Dependent Current Source Amplifier*

The example circuit of "Figure 10.5":#figure10-5 can be ‘generalized’ by replacing the fixed input voltage of 1 volt with a 'general' input of $V_{in}$, this is depicted in "Figure 10.6":#figure10-6.

p=(#figure10-6). !{width:70%}img/10/circuitsF10.6.jpg(Figure 10.6)!:img/10/circuitsF10.6.jpg
_Figure 10.6  Amplifier Circuit with Dependent Current Source_

Now we recalculate the output voltage, $V_{out}$, but this time, keep the general value for the input voltage as, $V_{in}$.  By use of the above relation, the output voltage remains as:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $-(2k)(5V_C)$

But now we calculate the control voltage $V_C$ by voltage divider acting on the $V_{in}$ volt input source as:

p=. $V_{C}$ = $(\frac{1k}{2k})$ $V_{in}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ $V_{in$}$ _volts_ 

Hence, the output voltage, $V_{out}$, is:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $-(2k)[5(frac{1}{2})V_{in} (mA)]$ = $-5V_{in}$ _volts_

This equation establishes the 'input-output' relationship that is produced by our circuit.  Notice that when we change the value of the input $V_{in}$, the output voltage, $V_{out}$, changes.  We could make a table of input and output values.

p=. *Input - Output Relation*
For the Dependent Source Circuit "Figure 10.6":#figure10-6

table. 
|=. $V_{in} (volt)$ |=. $V_{out} (volt)$ |
|=. 0 |=. 0 |
|=. 0.5 |=. -2.5 |
|=. 1 |=. -5 |
|=. 1.5 |=. -7.5 |
|=. 2 |=. -10 |


This table reveals that when the input voltage, $V_{in}$, is changed by +1 volt, the output voltage, $V_{out}$, changes by -5 volts.  This relationship could be expressed as:

p=. $\frac{\Delta V_{out}}{\Delta V_{in}}$ = -5

Where the 'delta' is the symbol for the amount of  'change'.  The 'Gain' of this circuit is -5. This circuit amplifies (takes an input voltage and makes a larger replica at the output).

<h4>
p=. Gain = $\frac{\Delta V_{out}}{\Delta V_{in}}$ = -5</h4>

Thus with our dependent source element, driven at the input by a voltage source, this circuit provides a specific function of amplification, whereby when an input voltage changes it produces a larger change of the output voltage


h4(#chapter10-fixed-gain). 10.3 - Dependent Source Fixed Gain Amplifier

Now lets use a dependent voltage source to produce a different form of amplifier, one with a fixed gain, which is _independent_ of the exact value of the dependent source and only dependent on a couple of fixed resistors.  To start, consider the circuit of "Figure 10.7":#figure10-7.


p=(#figure10-7). !{width:65%}img/10/circuitsF10.7.jpg(Figure 10.7)!:img/10/circuitsF10.7.jpg
_Figure 10.7  Fixed Gain Amplifier Circuit_

In this circuit the dependent voltage source has a constant of 'A' and the control voltage is the voltage difference between two nodes ($v_C$).  The input voltage is connected directly to the + side of $v_C$ node. The output voltage has resistor $R_2$ connected from the output to the negative side of $v_C$ node.  And finally resistor $R_1$ is connected from this node to ground.

These circuit elements and their connection produces the following three constraints:

# $V_{in}$ = $V_C + I_1R_1$
# $V_{out}$ = $A (V_C)$
# $I_1$ = $V_{out} / (R_1 + R_2)$

By substitution these three constraints can be reduced to the following:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $A[V_C]$ = $A[V_{in}-(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2})V_{out}]$

collecting terms in $V_{out}$:

p=. $V_{out}[A(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2})]$ = $A[V_{in}]$

and solving:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $\frac{A}{[1+A(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2})]}$ $[V_{in}]$

So Vout is a constant times $V_{in}$.  Now take the case where A is a large value, in particular:

p=. $A(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}) >> 1$ ...... or ...... $A >> (\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1})$

Then the '1' in the denominator is relatively small and is negligible compared to the 'A' term.  With this large 'A' value the expression for $V_{out}$ becomes:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $\frac{A}{[A(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2})]}$

The 'A' terms cancel, and the result is just:

p=. $V_{out}$ = $(\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1})[V_{in}]$

The *amplifier voltage gain*, $V_{out}/V_{in}$, is therefore:

p=. $\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$ = $(\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1})$

The voltage gain is _*independent*_ of the value of the constant 'A' in the dependent source (provided it is large enough).  The amplifier gain only depends on the ratio of terms with resistors values only.  It is relatively easy to make the ratio of resistor values accurate and reasonably constant.  Notice because 'A' is very large, the voltage difference ($v_C$) must be very small for any moderate size $V_{out}$.

p=. $(V_C)$ = $\frac{V_{out}}{A}$ << 1 ...... or ...... $V_C \approx $ very small

Furthermore, the requirement for a large 'A' causes the control voltage , ($V_C$), to be very small.  This is a key constraint employed in operational amplifiers and is discussed further in the next subsection.


h4(#chapter10-opamp-element). 10.4 - Operational Amplifier Circuit Elements

At this point we turn our attention toward a specific class of circuit elements, the operational amplifier.  This element is achieved by a 'dependent source' (within the opamp element, which is _energized by external fixed voltage sources_.  This arrangement is depicted in "Figure 10.8":#figure10-8.  Here $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$ are the external fixed voltage sources.


p=(#figure10-8). !{width:70%}img/10/circuitsF10.8.jpg(Figure 10.8)!:img/10/circuitsF10.8.jpg
_Figure 10.8  Operational Amplifier Structure;  Control, Output and Power Source_

The simplified view of the same opamp diagram is depicted in "Figure 10.9":#figure10-9.  Notice that the implied ground in the simplified figure is in fact always the common ground of the fixed power sources, Vcc and Vee, that energize the opamp, as explicitly depicted in "Figure 10.8":#figure10-8.  The power supplies are most often not explicitly shown, rather they are implied by the use of arrows and corresponding fixed voltage value labels, $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$.

** *10.4.1  Opamp Circuit Element Constraints*

The ideal opamp circuit element imposes very specific relationships for currents and voltages at its' input and output terminals, these are the _*element constraints* for an ideal opamp_, there are three:

# The currents into the $(pos)$ and $(neg)$ input terminals are zero. [$i_{+}$ = 0 .. and .. $i_{-}$ = 0]
# The two node voltages $v_{+}$ and $v_{-}$ are equal.  [$v_{+} = v_{-}$]
# The range of $V_{out}$ is less than $V_{CC}$ and greater than $-V_{EE}$.

But what is inside this new element, the opamp, which enables the device to implement these constraints?  Inside is effectively a voltage-dependent, voltage-source (VCVS) !  The control for the dependent voltage source is the difference voltage of $(v_{+} - v_{-})$.  In other words, this dependent-source is controlled by the control voltage, $V_C$, between the two input terminals, $V_C$ =  $(v_{+} - v_{-})$.  Furthermore, at the output terminals the real electronics that implement this dependent-source are not perfectly ideal, so the dependent-source has an effective (Thevenin Equivalent) output resistance, $r_O$.  Thus, we represent the output internal electronics of an opamp by a dependent-source, A$(v_{+} - v_{-})$, and series equivalent resistance, $r_O$, "Figure 10.10":#figure10-10, where A is the fixed gain of the VCVS.

p=(#figure10-10). !{width:57%}img/10/circuitsF10.10.jpg(Figure 10.10)!:img/10/circuitsF10.10.jpg
_Figure 10.10  Equivalent Circuit Model For Opamp_

In order for the opamp to be _controlled by voltages_ at the two input terminals, $v_{+}$ and $v_{-}$, the opamp employs internal electronics that require essentially _no input current_.  While in fact the input current is not absolutely zero, it is effectively so small, such as 10-8 ampere or smaller, that it can be neglected compared to other currents in the circuit.  Thus, we have our _first element constraint for an opamp_:

** *(1) The current into the '+' and '-' control inputs is zero !*

p=. $i_{(+)}$ = 0 ...... and ......$i_{(-)}$ = 0

Hence, when a circuit is connected to the input terminals of an opamp, the currents into the opamp _at the input terminals_ are zero.

Now lets consider the output of our opamp.  The output dependent-source has the value of: a _constant_ (A) times the _voltage difference_ $(v_{+} - v_{-})$.  For all our opamps the value of the gain constant, A, is _very very very large_.  Think a million or more.  The result of this very large gain, A $\to \infty$, is to limit the voltage difference $(v_{+} - v_{-})$.  Why?  Well notice that the open-circuit voltage vo is:

p=. $v_0$ = $A(v_{+} - v_{-})$

And hence,

p=. $(v_{+} - v_{-})$ = $\frac{v_0}{A}$

But since A is very very large, and $v_O$ cannot be very large only some volts ($v_O$ stays within the supply voltages $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$) we find the control difference voltage must be very very small (think microvolts), so:

p=. $(v_{+} - v_{-})$ = $\Rightarrow \frac{v_0}{\infty}$ $\Rightarrow$ = 0 ... as ... A $\Rightarrow \infty$

This yields the _second opamp element constraint_:

** *(2)	The two voltages $v_{+}$ and $v_{-}$ are considered to be equal !*

p=. $v_{+}$ = $v_{-}$

The last element constraint is to set the range limit for the output voltage.  As stated above this limit is due to the two fixed value voltage sources used to power the opamp and they limit the maximum and minimum output values to their values, respectively.  Thus _the third element constraint_ for the opamp is:

** *(3)	The range of $V_{out}$ is less than $V_{CC}$ and greater than $V_{EE}$:*
